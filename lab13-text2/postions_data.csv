We must enact constitutional amendments and federal laws that will put an end to all forms of discrimination and inequality based on gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, and HIV/AIDS positive status. The United States must immediately ratify the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). Our foreign policy must dictate equality for women and LGBT people as a condition of receiving foreign aid from the United States. We must expand access to confidential HIV/AIDS testing. Women in the workplace must have equal opportunities based on ability and achievement, therefore we must break the system of patriarchy. Women’s reproductive health care services such as access to contraception and abortion must be protected, expanded, and covered via a single-payer healthcare program, Medicare for All. Sexual harassment must be treated as an act of serious misconduct in the workplace. Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Trans people, and those of Alaska Native/Native American “Two Spirit” identities must no longer face discrimination, and with access to culturally competent health care options such as PrEP (preventative medication to prevent HIV infection) we can end the HIV/AIDS epidemic in America that has disproportionately impacted the LGBT community, as well as women of color and those living in poverty, and reduce health care costs by preventing new infections. Trans people must be able to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity and receive full health care coverage via Medicare for All, covering all medically necessary treatments without discrimination. If someone is in the workplace, securing a place to live, or otherwise living life in America, being LGBT should not be grounds for discrimination. LGBT students must have their rights protected and be supported for who they are in both K-12 and Higher Education environments across the country.

This means I believe in science-based sex education, affordable contraception availability, affordable wellness and maternity care for women, and access to safe and legal abortions. Research shows that female managers are highly effective; women CEOs deliver strong returns, yet women continue to fight to be equal at work.   Female college graduates earn an average of $10,400 less than males when starting their careers, and the divide continues all the way up the ladder.

"24","McFadden, Garrick","Garrick McFadden AZ",0,"Equal pay for equal work is a concept inherent in American values, and yet it is still is not borne out in practice. Today, women only earn 79 cents for every dollar a man makes, despite the laws in place and progress made. Women of color face an even greater gap. And these disparities only grow with time, jeopardizing women’s ability to retire. In Congress, I will fight to close these holes so that everyone who does the same work receives the same reward and has an equal chance to succeed. I support the Paycheck Fairness Act, the enactment of which will be a huge first step to pay parity. While the Equal Pay Act of 1963 does make it illegal for an employer to pay men and women differently for substantially equal work, the act has loopholes this new legislation will fill. For example, employers often use an applicant’s salary history as a means of setting that person’s new compensation. However, if a female candidate has historically been paid less than the standard wage for the position based on her sex, such questions only perpetuate the discrimination. The Paycheck Fairness Act generally prohibits employers from requiring applicants to provide their salary history during the interview and hiring process and ensures that once hired, employees are able to talk about their pay amongst one another without fear of retaliation by their employer. The Act also requires employers to prove that any pay disparities that do exist in the workforce exist for a legitimate job-related reason consistent with business necessity, something that was not previously codified. The Paycheck Fairness Act, however, cannot solve every barrier to closing the pay gap. Prohibitions on paying persons less based on characteristics other than sex must also be explored and enacted. Moreover, bias can even occur before an applicant obtains an interview based on the fact the person’s name or other information stereotypically implies a certain sex, race, etc. The solution to the pay gap must therefore also include other proposals such as the use of a blind application process. 

I also want to close the loophole for victims of crime committed at the hands of a boyfriend or girlfriend, sometimes called the intimate violence loophole. The presence of a gun in an abusive relationship increases a woman’s risk of homicide by 500%. That is one of the reasons persons convicted of certain domestic violence crimes are prohibited from buying or owning a gun. However, that prohibition only applies to specific relationships. It does not apply to persons who are dating unless they have a child together, were previously married, live or lived together as spouses or are otherwise similarly situated. And it does not apply to misdemeanor stalking. We must do better and close this gap in coverage so that all victims of such violence are protected.",0,0,2
"25","Tipirneni, Hiral","Hiral Tipirneni AZ",1,"I fervently believe our elected representatives should support policies reflecting clearly established women’s reproductive health rights. In short, abortions should stay safe, legal, and rare. And, for the record, no one is “pro-abortion” – one is essentially either pro-choice or anti-choice. The heart-wrenching, deeply personal decision to end a pregnancy should be between a woman, her partner, her doctor, and her faith. There is no role for politicians in that decision. We cannot go back to the days, which are not so far in the past, of coat-hanger abortions and women bleeding to death in alleys. In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court has set clear precedent in the “law of the land,” and policy decisions should be in accordance with that principle. It should also be noted that late-term terminations, which can be particularly traumatic, are less than 1% of all terminations, and only done in cases of risk to the mother’s health or life-threatening developmental issues with the fetus. Of course, avoiding an unwanted pregnancy is the BEST way to reduce the number of terminations. Data has definitively shown that abortion rates drop when there is simple access to contraception and sex-education.

"27","Combs, Gwen","Gwen Combs AR",1,"I am an advocate for choice in healthcare. As a woman, I understand the specific health needs of women and I am an advocate for choice. Decisions about a women’s reproductive care, including abortion, should be between a women, her family, and her doctor. Quality healthcare is a human right. Investing in healthcare creates healthy and happy citizens that will propel our society forward. Once in Congress, health care will be my top priority. I will fight to ensure that more people are covered, expenses are lowered, and coverage is equitable and accessible. Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicaid Expansion must be preserved and mental and behavioral health coverage should be accessible and affordable.

All of us deserve financial security in the form of living wages tied to inflation, a strong economy, and the preservation of Medicare and Social Security, also tied to inflation.   I believe in economic fairness for all, and aim to secure it by focusing on minimum wage, women’s rights in the workplace, benefits for veterans, and Social Security. Even in Arkansas, where the minimum wage is above the national rate, a person must work 54 hours a week to afford a two-bedroom apartment. We must raise our minimum wage to $15 an hour, so that all workers are guaranteed to live with dignity. This applies to immigrants as well, so they have the representation and pay that their hard work warrants. We must ensure that businesses provide women with equal pay for equal work by 2025, through the use of tax incentives for and tougher enforcement where standards already exist. Women deserve paid family and sick leave, and I will work to require employers to provide them with both; they also deserve high-quality, affordable healthcare, and my goal is to make it accessible for them. 

Our country has come so far in our fight for equality, and it is our duty to carry the torch for everyone still struggling for their rights.   The principle of equality for all is vital to our democracy and identity as Americans. Knowing this, I will make it my goal to protect the rights that every one of us holds so dearly. Every American, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, deserves protection from harassment, violence, and discrimination--be it in the workplace, or with regard to housing or healthcare. The fight for these protections must be a national one, and I pledge to help lead it. I vow to pass a new equal rights law which will guarantee hiring equity as well as equal pay for equal work, and put an end to all disparities in employment, policing, housing, sentencing, and compensation based on race, religion, gender, or sexuality by 2025. I will also expand legal protections for women and people of color against discrimination, harassment, and abuse, and ensure that they are properly enforced. Furthermore, I aim to secure equality in all aspects of reproductive healthcare, including abortion; to make this possible, I will commit to repealing the Hyde amendment, so that federal funds can be directed toward abortion.",0,0,2
"28","Spencer, Paul","Paul Spencer AR",0,"From the first day that I declared my candidacy for Arkansas’s Second Congressional District seat, I also stated my pro-life position which is quite rare among Democratic politicians and generated quite a bit of press early on. Since this is such an unusual position for a Democrat, I feel that it is necessary to elaborate on my position with the hopes of fostering dialogue on all sides of the political spectrum in a respectful manner. Many in the pro-life community advocate for a complete ban on abortion in the hopes of ending all abortion. I respectfully submit several problems that I see with this position.  If one were to overturn Roe, we would simply return to an era of widespread illegal abortion. Individuals could still receive abortions from sympathetic medical professionals, travel to other jurisdictions that still provide abortions, or receive dangerous, unsafe, or not-regulated abortions. Regardless of the legal standing of the means--the action and its effect would continue. As in many other situations, simply outlawing particular actions has not made them effectively cease in society.   If Roe were to be overturned, abortion would be classified among crimes like murder, theft, assault, and rape, which are everyday occurrences in the United States, although they are illegal. These latter offenses are theoretically easily policed and the perpetrators sanctioned. Furthermore, the policing of such actions is vigorously supported by our society. This would not be the case with the policing of illegal abortions in a theoretical post-Roe world. Given the normalization of abortion within society today, a widespread outcry for and the vigorous prosecution of illegal abortions would not be present. If one believes that abortion is a grave tragedy, one should be as troubled by abortions that would occur illegally as well. A more comprehensive solution is to work for a just society which would diminish the underlying deprivations which give rise to many abortions. As we know, the abortion debate is probably the most divisive and polarizing political issue of our time.  As in virtually every other area of law and civil society, one side must accept the government’s, vis-à-vis the people’s, right to regulate a practice that the other side finds limitlessly unacceptable in every situation. The reality is that the state makes allowances for abortion in varying circumstances (life of the mother, rape, incest, viability). These exceptions may never be acceptable for some.  Conversely, others want unrestricted abortion allowed at every stage. Established law has already legislated restrictions on abortion, which cannot be overlooked in country that is governed by the rule of law. As in so many other issues in society, the law, in balancing the different perceptions of rights for different groups leaves no one side feeling completely vindicated. But as a nation that believes the rule of law is the bedrock of a civil society, ultimately both sides must reconcile what each deems as their most desired outcome with what the law prescribes. Although I am morally opposed to the practice of abortion because I believe an unborn child is a human life, I recognize as legitimate this compromise that decades of law have established on the issue. I support policy such as the Pregnant Women Support Act which was passed along with the Affordable Care Act which gives women in crisis pregnancies support and other options besides abortion. I support a paid-maternity leave, which would allow mothers to spend time with their child in the vital, early stages of life. I also support Medicare For All, which would provide healthcare to all persons regardless of their income, gender, or background. I also support equal pay for equal work, which should be requirement for all employers. I support the upholding of the Hyde Amendment which has prohibited the use of federal funds for abortion for the last four decades. Conversely, I do not support the Federal defunding of Planned Parenthood since our society does not have a comprehensive and universally accessible health system that serves all people.  Planned Parenthood provides many services such as family planning and cancer screenings to which many women would otherwise have no access. None of the federal funding Planned Parenthood receives can legally be spent on abortion services. My belief in the inherent dignity and sacredness of human life compels me to not only seek to protect life in its most vulnerable stage, but to also fight to uphold dignified living circumstances at every stage. If we are truly committed to protecting life, we must refuse to settle for a healthcare system in which tens of thousands of Americans die each year because of lack of access to healthcare in the wealthiest country in the world. A consistent pro-life view rejects the philosophy that human labor is a commodity to be traded on the free market with wages as low as the market will allow. Our pro-life worldview should compel us to welcome the immigrant and the refugee that are fleeing unlivable situations to make a better life for their family.   We must be as troubled by gun violence in our communities and unjust wars overseas as we are by abortion. We must recognize the view of Pope Francis that economies of exclusion also kill. We must reject the perverse reordering of the societal hierarchy that sees “corporate persons” as having the same Constitutional rights as actual human persons that are created in the image and likeness of God. Pro-life voters deserve other choices than political candidates whose only pro-life position is the banning of abortion. We must hold these politicians accountable at election time when they support legislation that denies their constituent’s right to live a dignified life. Conversely, those of us who advocate for social justice must be aware that “quality of life issues” mean nothing to a person that has been deprived of life in the womb. For both sides, a thoughtful and solicitous balance must be struck that encompasses the bounds of theology, responsible law, responsible social citizenship, and gentle humanity’s decency as we strive to compassionately serve the needs and honor the dignity of human life in all its forms.",0,0,2

Mike Coffman voted against equal pay for women. In Congress I will always fight to ensure that women are paid equally for the work they do. Colorado families are working hard to make ends meet, a task made harder when a family welcomes a new child or someone falls sick and paid leave is not available. We cannot support parents, promote early childhood development, or care for our aging generations without policies that make it possible for American workers to care for their families without fear of losing pay or their jobs. I believe it is time to move our economy into the 21st century. That includes modern family leave policies. I will fight to ensure that all workers are able to care for their families without enduring financial hardship – whether they need sick time, parental leave, or time to care for family members.   Existing penalties are woefully inadequate to punish those who abused their power and violated the trust of their subordinates and the American people.We must hold our elected leaders to a higher standard of conduct. When ethics investigations find that members of Congress have committed sexual harassment or assault – or they resign to avoid the consequences of such an investigation – they should lose their congressional pension. I will fight to protect a woman’s right to choose. Women should have the right to make health care decisions that are right for them and their families. It is truly shameful that we still have to defend a woman’s right to make her own health care choices. Stripping women’s health care funding from the federal budget and removing protections for women’s health care from our laws will hurt families across the country and in Colorado. In Congress, I will protect a woman’s right to choose, while simultaneously working to continue funding critical resources like Planned Parenthood. I will also fight to ensure that protections for maternity care are not removed from our health care laws and that families are able to take paid sick leave. I look at my daughter and cannot stand to think that she will have to wage this same fight when she is grown. But you do not have to have a daughter to support women and families across the country.",0,0,2

"52","Sevigny, Stephen","Stephen Sevigny FL",0,"Too many Americans are falling farther behind in today’s economy. We need to build an economy where everyone has a chance to thrive. To do that requires reforming immigration, healthcare, education, and investing in innovation and infrastructure. We also need to increase access to capital and crack down on large companies that use their size to make the market less competitive. “Work hard and follow the rules – your success is limited only by your abilities and aspirations.” This idea is the foundation of the American Dream. Unfortunately, this is no longer true for too many young and middle-class American families who are being left behind and shut out of the modern American economy. Too many families are struggling to make ends meet, let alone get ahead and realize their dreams. Too many work part-time when they want to work full-time. Too many live paycheck to paycheck. Too many who might start a business are afraid of losing health insurance. As well as being a doctor, I’m also a small business owner – my wife Gina (also a doctor) and I make a payroll every month. We need a crash program to help small businesses start and grow, and provide support to those businesses who really are “job creators,” not subsidies and tax breaks for multinational corporations. We must retool our education system to prepare people of all ages for their first job, or their next job, without burying them in crippling debt that leaves them unable to engage in the American economy. We must direct our economic policies toward investment in education and research, innovation as a primary driver of job growth and infrastructure repair and improvements. Many new companies and products are based upon publicly funded research, but we have been scaling back on basic and applied-science funding. Increasing funding can provide entrepreneurs with knowledge and ideas for new products. The job creators I meet when working with the bank do not want federal handouts, they want an educated workforce to help grow their businesses. They want affordable stable healthcare so that their employees can show to work healthy, ready to work. The average salary in Volusia County is up to 20% below the state average.

Moreover, our economy suffers and is made weaker when parents are forced to exit the workforce to care for children or relatives. Paid family leave would decrease the rate of parents dropping out of the workforce, increase economic productivity, lead to better wages for parents returning to work, and strengthen American families. Equal Pay for Equal Work: There is no question that the gender pay gap is real, and it is even more pronounced among women of color. This is not only a problem for women, but a problem for American families, and for our economy.

What will it take for Wall Street and Main Street to treat people equally? How hard is it to pay women the same as men for the same work?  Should we encourage pay discrimination lawsuits? Maybe use the justice department to impose civil fines? Maybe bringing back the ERA and create lawsuits for violating civil rights? DO we shame these companies into compliance? There is undeniable that white women are paid less then men for the same work and this discrepancy is greater with minority women. This is unfair to the worker, and detrimental to families and slows economic growth for the nation. It is much easier for companies to fix this internally, then the costs associated with new legislation. I urge business to take a hard look on this social problem. If you have a suggestion on how to screen and enforce equal pay for equal rights please send me an email. Together, we can arrive at a workable solution.

I am Pro-Choice and Pro Reproductive Rights which include both the right to have children and the right not to be forced to. It is remarkable that this debate continues, in spite of the 1973 decision of Roe. I fully support a women’s right to choose her own future, including reproductive choices. Here are some of my reasons why. The conservative agenda is hypocritical. They preach that they want medical care to be between a patient and their doctor and for the government to stay out of it. At the same time they advocate for, and legislate obstacles to obtain legal procedures.  Many states have enacted roadblocks to abortions. These roadblocks include laws that require a women to have an ultrasound before an abortion and in many of these instances, a transvaginal ultrasound is required. (Transvaginal means “through the vagina” wherein a probe is inserted into the women for as long as 60 minutes). Where is the, “Keep the government out of our medical decisions” outrage from the conservative leadership. In the 2015/2016 congressional session, a bill was introduced to require all women in the Country to undergo these examinations before an abortion can be obtained. This bill is still pending. It is wrong to tell a women that she must go to term and have a child she did not plan for or want. Many unwanted pregnancies are caused by  birth control failure, unavailability, or expense. (Before the ACA, many insurance policies did not pay for women’s birth control). It is interesting to note that the ACA required no co-pay birth control. As a result, the numbers of abortions fell to new lows. Despite this remarkable achievement of reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies, the republicans were hell bent on eliminating the ACA, the very reason unwanted pregnancies and abortions are down. If abortions are outlawed, who will be punished? Will it be the Doctor that performs the procedure or the women that gets it? How will we treat the women that want an abortion, for what ever reason, and they ingest chemicals or use a coat hanger to attempt an abortion  themselves? (Our pre Roe history shows this was not uncommon). If abortions are outlawed, will women be responsible for the outcome of the pregnancy? Will she be charged with a crime if the pregnancy ends in a miscarriage or spontaneous abortion? Will she be accused and charged with the crime of performing her own abortion if she naturally miscarries? What if the birth produces a child with birth defects, will the women be charged with not having proper prenatal care or not taking extra precautions to protect the pregnancy? Will the doctor be charged with not properly caring for the pregnancy if it naturally aborts  or has birth defects? Will we go back to the days when women did not go for prenatal care because they were afraid of being prosecuted for having an unhealthy lifestyle? There is no end to the potential consequences. I was raised by a single mother with three sisters.  I can say, without a doubt, that women possess the sensibilities, intelligence, and ability to make healthcare decisions, including her own reproductive decisions,  just as a man possesses for his own decisions.

As we approach the centennial of universal suffrage, we must recognize that there is still work to be done. American women make up slightly more than half of our population.  While most issues affect woman the same that they do men, there are areas of special concern that I will be focusing on. The burden of family planning has fallen largely on women.  Contraceptive choices are something best left up to the woman and their medical providers. I understand the financial burdens that women face every day. The ACA gives women access to contraceptive services without an additional co-pay. However, the Trump Administration has issued rules that widen the range of employers and insurers that can invoke religious or moral beliefs to avoid the ACA requirement that birth control pills and other contraceptives be covered by insurance as part of preventive care. When I’m in Congress, I will fight to restore the law to its plain meaning. The ACA removed the pre-existing condition exclusion for many conditions women face.  Some insurers used to treat a Cesarean section as a prior condition and would not cover the subsequent need for that procedure, even in the case of an emergency.  The ACA also removed the “women’s tax” on health care premiums, charging women a higher premium just for being a woman.  I will fight any attempt to return us to those days.\n\nWe need to keep in place the requirement that women can get treatment by an OB/GYN without the need for a referral or prior approval, regardless of the type of insurance a woman has. I am committed to preserving a woman’s right to choose and maintaining safe access to reproductive health services. Sensitive decisions should be left up to the judgment of a woman and her doctor.\n\nI also supported legislation that would expand access to preventive health care services to help reduce unintended pregnancies, which would have the effect of reducing the need for abortions, as part of a comprehensive plan to improve access to women’s health care.  I oppose the assault on women’s health care, including efforts to slash federal funding to health clinics where millions of women get access to critical health care services. Cutting funding for these vital programs only serves to imperil women’s health. We need to close the wage gap between men and women in this country.  Women still only earn 77 cents for every dollar earned by men.  We need to strongly implement the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act – the law makes it easier to sue over gender discrimination in the workplace.

There are simple steps we can take to eliminate sex, race and disability-based pay inequity. One such proposal of mine follows. Wage transparency is the missing ingredient in creating conditions that result in pay equity. The US should establish a database called Equal Pay for Equal Work (EPEW). Glassdoor already does this in a sense, but imagine the concept applied on a nationwide scale. EPEW would collect information from individuals by default, but would offer an opportunity to opt out for those concerned with privacy. Employers would be required to provide the employee’s position title, educational level and number of years of related experience on three new fields on the W-4, and individuals who do not specifically opt out would answer 3 additional, simple questions on those W-4s regarding sex, race and disability status. This both protects individual privacy and requires nearly zero additional administrative burden. EPEW would then harvest wage data derived from tax returns (for individuals who have not opted out) to determine salaries for comparison. Next, the collected data would de-personalized (removing name, social security number and such) while preserving responses to questions about employer, educational level, position title, years of related experience, sex, race and disability status – creating an “entry.” Finally, all of the EPEW entries for a specific company would be matched together and uploaded to an online public database which would be searchable according to company, educational attainment, position title, years of experience, sex, race, disability status, or some combination of those items. This transparency would harness market forces to pressure companies into doing the right thing without bringing the hammer of government down on businesses by mandating specific wages for specific jobs.

Considering how centrally my work involved babies, it should come as no surprise that I’ve developed a sense of the delicacy of human life. I am also a cynic on the politics of this issue: in my experience, interest groups sometimes treat women’s bodies as political tools to political ends when it advantages them to do so. This suggests to me that we are not treating women with the respect they deserve, and we must change that. Women must have the choice of both bodily autonomy and bringing life into the world, and we should stand ready to support them either way. Accordingly, it is my personal belief that abortion should be safe, legal and rare, and more than that, wholly unnecessary. I recognize this is a divisive issue with sincere beliefs and legitimate points being made by both sides. But in the crossfire, we tend to forget about babies and mothers the minute babies are born. It’s not enough to simply be pro-life or pro-choice. Let’s be honest: single mothers have the deck stacked against them in meaningful and enduring ways. We need to socially evolve on this issue and make it so women can choose to carry babies to term without upending their lives. A child should never be seen as a burden – either by their parents or society In the same vein, every child should be a wanted child. Both women and men should have the option of paid parental leave (perhaps through early distribution of earned social security benefits) and access to reproductive healthcare, family planning and related services. Abortion should never need to be used as birth control, so we need to provide universal, comprehensive sex education and proactively distribute contraceptives. It may sound counterintuitive, but this is actually fiscally and socially responsible policy. Having babies is expensive, and babies whose parents are prepared or supported inevitably will have better family outcomes. Approaching this topic pragmatically, I believe it’s possible to bring abortion down to levels approaching 0% in a way that doesn’t restrict women’s bodily autonomy: by strengthening our adoption, family and child care policies to better support mothers.",0,0,2
"87","McBath, Lucy","Lucy McBath GA",1,"I am a two-time breast cancer survivor, so I understand firsthand how essential healthcare options are for women all throughout the country. That is why I oppose the Trump-Handel plan to defund Planned Parenthood. 2.4 million individuals receive health care services from Planned Parenthood every year, and I will fight tooth and nail for the essential services that Planned Parenthood provides. In this vein, I fully support funding programs that help enable women to have the autonomy to make reproductive decisions. This includes greater access to contraception products and family planning services. Furthermore, I fundamentally believe that everyone should earn equal pay for equal work. I support the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and I wish to build on that law to make workplaces more equitable for Georgia women. One way to improve the lives of working women and their families is to ensure paid family leave. The United States is the only industrialized country in the world to not offer parental leave, and I will support legislation that would allow working mothers and fathers to care for their children appropriately. Studies suggest that paid maternal leave boosts employer productivity while also has tangible, positive health effects for parents and newborns alike. Paid maternity and paternity leave is just common sense. Another common sense piece of legislation that I wholeheartedly support is the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). VAWA has been an essential tool to protect women and to prosecute those who have committed violent crimes against them.

The US is the only developed country in the world that does not provide even a modest form of paid family leave. (Source: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/25/kirsten-gillibrand/yes-us-only-industrialized-nation-without-paid-fam/)We do need to be sensitive to the business implications in the design of such a policy as well as the fiscal implications for the federal budget.

PAID FAMILY LEAVE, FREE CHILD AND ELDER CARE, AND $500 CHILD ALLOWANCES To ensure equal opportunity for men and women we have to balance the demands of work and family.

Women make up 83% of the heads of single parent households and more than 2/3rds of the family members who care for elders. 50 years after the passage of the Equal Pay Act, women still earn significantly less than men do while having significantly fewer leadership positions in business and government.

This ultimately amounts to discrimination against women, and therefore should not be tolerated. I support the Lilly Ledbetter Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, both of which seek to prevent employers from discriminating against female employees.  \n            \t\t\t\n            \t\t\n            \t\t\n            \t\t\tProtecting reproductive rights - The government has no right to dictate a woman’s choices when it comes to her own body. I am proudly pro-choice, and would not support any Supreme Court nominee who sought to overturn Roe v. Wade. It is very disturbing to see Republicans’ reckless attempts to defund Planned Parenthood, which is the only option for care in many rural areas of the country. This all being said, I think it is important to remember that to many Republicans, abortion is the only issue that matters. Just as we don’t understand how they don’t see climate change as a problem, they don’t understand why we don’t see abortion as a problem. If we could meet them halfway and work together on preventing the unwanted pregnancies that often lead to difficult choices, we would remove a lot of their impulse to restrict access to safe abortions.\n            \t\t\n            \t\t\n            \t\t\t\n            \t\t\t\tExpanding maternity and family leave - No woman should have to choose between caring for a loved one or losing her job, and neither should they have to go back to work immediately after having a baby. The United States is one of only four countries in the world that doesn’t guarantee paid maternity leave. Employers are only required to offer 12 weeks of unpaid leave, and only half of all workers are employed at a company subject to that regulation. We need to make sure all mothers (and fathers, for that matter) are guaranteed those 12 weeks of leave, and that they are paid for it.",0,0,2

"139","Rodriguez, Junius","Junius Rodriguez IL",0,"Rodriguez Sees Multifaceted Remedies to Addressing the Wage Gap\nLabor Day presents the perfect time for focusing upon one of the more persistent problems that plagues the labor market—the gender-based wage gap. On average women earn less than men, but the causes of this problem are multifaceted and extend far beyond the casual assumption that wage inequality for equitable work is the key culprit. In fact, federal law has prohibited employers from gender-based wage discrimination since passage of the Equal Pay Act (1963) and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (1964), and this was reinforced in 2009 with the passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.That the wage gap has persisted through the years is evidence that systemic and institutional factors are at play that contribute to this problem.\nSince women constitute nearly two-thirds of workers who are employed at minimum wage jobs, an effort to raise the minimum wage is one of the means that can be used to address the wage gap. The purchasing power of the minimum wage (adjusted for inflation) has been erratic through the years, and the relative value of a minimum wage salary has declined by nearly 20 percent since the last hike in minimum wage occurred back in 2009. I would like to see the federal government implement a three-year tiered plan to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 by 2019. Individual states and cities would retain the right to use a minimum wage that his higher than the federal standard, but this adjustment would significantly raise the threshold so that wage gap differences would be lessened.\nThe federal minimum wage for tipped labor, which stands at $2.13 per hour, has not been raised in the past fifteen years. Since women also constitute the vast majority of American workers who are employed as tipped laborers, an increase in the tipped minimum wage would also have an impact upon efforts to remedy the wage gap. I believe that the federal minimum tipped wage should ultimately be $5.05 (half of the newly proposed minimum wage) to be achieved on a three-year tiered plan of increase. These two initiatives would go a long way in helping to remedy much of the wage differences that account for the wage gap.\nOther factors that must be considered if we hope to address the wage gap are the levels of support that we find at the state and federal levels to help provide safe and affordable child care for working women as well as substantial investment in early childhood education programs. All too often women who labor among the so-called “working poor” must make the choice of whether or not they can work due to the financial constraints that child care costs provide. Frequently reliance on family to provide such services, or other less than ideal circumstances, is used as a stopgap measure, but interruptions in such arrangements makes it difficult for one to sustain employment for an extended period of time.\nWe often consider the circumstances of the wage gap as a stand-alone story that is secondary to other public policy concerns, but we must use a more holistic approach to recognize the severity of this issue and summon the means to address it. The wage gap has a direct correlation to poverty in the United States, and by curious circumstance women and children are those who fall victim to poverty more often than not. In addition, among many poor and single-parent families women are the primary breadwinners, so wage barriers merely perpetuate the cycle of poverty for many. Although the policy initiatives that are outlined here may not be the ultimate systemic solution that will remedy the wage gap, they certainly will move us closer to a more equitable wage differential in American society.  \n \n\n",0,0,0

"142","Hackett, Pat","Pat Hackett IN",1,"Dignity And Justice For Women\nRecognizing the dignity of women and promoting justice for women are essential to our democracy. In particular, women’s right to privacy regarding their reproductive decisions is directly tied to their dignity and moral authority as human beings, and the recognition that it is exactly by sexual violation, coercion, and control by others that women’s right to justice has been denied. True pro-life legislation protects both women in their bodies from the coercive power of the state and protects the life of the unborn by addressing the social, economic, and medical realities that create many of the circumstances that lead to abortion. The protection of women’s bodies from the coercive power of the state is a constitutionally protected liberty interest. Women have the right to make all decisions concerning their bodies, including their reproductive health. We only have to look at our current global reality of forced sterilizations, nonconsensual childhood marriage, forced pregnancy, forced abortion, and female genital mutilation where women do not have a constitutionally guaranteed right to their own bodies to understand how misguided the debate on these issues is. In many cases, these constitutionally guaranteed rights are also ignored and abused in our nation.\nTrue pro-life legislation would wage a cultural war on poverty. Indiana is the 6th worst state in the nation with regard to the gender pay gap1. Women who work full time earn only 74% of what men make. This gap only increases for African American, Hispanic, and Native American women. Additionally, infant care costs are 15.6% of the median Hoosier family income2. Maternal mortality rates during pregnancy in Indiana are 1.75 times that of the national average3. More than 8 percent of Hoosier women are raped before they reach the age of 184. These statistics are unacceptable. All women should have the ability to access safe, affordable, local, and high-quality health care. Ensuring dignity and justice for women must include a commitment to supporting struggling families and children, to safe and affordable housing, to quality public education, and to life-long social services that are essential to the health and well-being of individuals and their families.\n1 American Association of University Women (AAUW) 2017, The Simple Truth about the Gender Pay Gap, https://www.aauw.org/aauw_check/pdf_download/show_pdf.php?file=The-Simple-Truth\n2 Economic Policy Institute (EPI) 2016, Child Care Costs in the United States, http://www.epi.org/child-care-costs-in-the-united-states/\n3 America’s Health Rankings 2016, United Health Foundation, 2016 Health of Women and Children Report, https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/2016-health-of-women-and-children-report/measure/maternal_mortality/state/IN\n4Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2017, The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey: 2010-2012 State Report, https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf",0,0,0

Like our former Presidents, I support “Safe, Legal, and Rare” and a women’s right to choose. Despite our differences, most every American can agree on two things: (1) people should have the right to make their own family planning decisions and (2) we should care for those making remarkably difficult decisions and comfort those affected by them.\nPeople have the liberty to make their own family planning decisions. We don’t want the government to control every pregnancy. Likewise we don’t want government to mandate we have 10 children either. We want the freedom to decide and our democracy should protect that right. Even the most “single issue” voters in our community practice family planning.\nFamily planning decisions, especially those that are a result of an unplanned pregnancy, are likely the most difficult life decision women and a family can make.

This is how we avoid abortions -- access to birth control and sex education for our young people so we avoid unwanted pregnancies.\n\nWe have one of the highest known rates of teen pregnancy and births in developed countries. Young people in the Netherlands, who have the second lowest teen pregnancy rate, have access to sex education and contraception.\n\nWe also have great differences in poverty and wealth in our country. There are much higher rates of teen pregnancy in disadvantaged youth. These are the underlying issues that create unplanned and unwanted pregnancies.\n\nI want to talk about late-term abortions, because most people don't realize what these actually are. These are devastating procedures to end a pregnancy when a baby is not yet able to live outside of the womb. The decision to abort is a medical decision based upon testing that show the baby will be born with life-threatening illnesses or serious physical defects that will result in a short and brutal life of pain and suffering for that baby.\n\nAnother medical reason for a late-term abortion is the mother's deteriorating health during the pregnancy and the high risk of death of the mother should she continue the pregnancy. These decisions are traumatic and not at all what the mother and parents want to have to make. Late-term abortions are tragic, rare, and they are difficult decisions for the mother, the father, and the physician.\n\nNo legislator has a right to interfere with this.  It's akin to telling a cancer patient they can't have medical care that may put their cancer in remission or save their life.

"189","McGrath, Amy","Amy McGrath KY",1,"Let’s talk about sexual harassment. It's such an important, and long overdue conversation for us to have as a nation.\nFirst, we cannot let it become a partisan issue. Otherwise, it will become a political football and never be dealt with by our society, and we lose a crucial opportunity for meaningful reckoning, healing, and education. This affliction doesn’t fall along partisan lines — Roy Moore, John Conyers, Harvey Weinstein, Charlie Rose, Al Franken, Donald Trump, and the list goes on.\nAll inappropriate physical harassment perpetrated by those in power upon women (or men) is wrong and cannot be tolerated, and predatory behavior towards children/teenagers, as is alleged in Alabama regarding Roy Moore, should be treated for what it is — outright child molestation.\nThis cultural shift may well represent a watershed moment. It is likely that more women will speak out against prominent political and establishment figures, and they should. We've come to learn that predatory behavior doesn’t typically happen just once. When the first courageous person decides to speak out, we have to expect that more will follow and what we have been ignoring in our workplaces and professions for some time will begin to surface. We have to resist the natural impulse to give the benefit of the doubt for those we tend to like, but not those on the other side. Bad behavior by Democrats should not be viewed as less detrimental to us than by those we disagree with politically.\nWe had (and continue to have) this problem in our military. I lived through times in my career where the culture was such that speaking out was certainly not in the best interest of one's career. Be silent, look the other way, don't cause waves, brush it off...these were all coping mechanisms for many women in the military. But the military has made strides in this area and I could see a real positive difference during my 24-year career.\nIn my experience, the very best way to combat this type of behavior is for leaders to foster an environment of respect for all, and one where anyone can feel like he/she can come forward (without repercussion) should there be sexual harassment or assault. That means leaders must make known their expectations that the behavior will never be tolerated nor covered up, and of course follow through with it (even when the perpetrator is someone high ranking or well known to the leader).\nAlso, it was only when women began to rise in the officer and enlisted ranks that the systemic harassment and hazing began to subside in the units that had women. When the military ranks were largely an all-boys club, this behavior went largely unchecked. It was the promotion of more senior women officers and senior enlisted that made a difference. That's an incredibly important lesson. When we see more women in places like corporate board rooms and elected to office, it will be harder to get away with abusive behavior.\nFinally, we have to look out for each other, regardless of gender. Each of us (men and women) can make a real difference when we stand up, say something, and refuse to look the other way. Often, it takes only one person to intervene. When the perpetrator is the person in power, we have to foster a society where people can come forward and hold their leaders publicly accountable too.",0,0,2

Standing with WomenNearly every day, it seems there are new developments regarding sexual harassment, assault and domestic violence by the likes of Harvey Weinstein, Roy Moore, and Donald Trump. I've dealt with bullies like them before. I've taken them on and won. Standing up, taking responsibility, showing empathy for others, and speaking truth to power are part of who I am.In 1982, I was working in Talbot County as a 31-year old trial lawyer when I learned that my boss, the senior partner, was sexually abusing firm clients. When confronted he flatly denied it. The firm fired him, made me a partner and contacted the victims to report the abuse.The victims chose to not report it. They wanted their privacy – no lawsuits, no news stories, no spotlight. Their decision was personal and confidential and protected under attorney-client privilege. The abuser sued the firm and all its members, including me. He pretended the abuse had never occurred, concocted bogus claims about why he was fired and sued each of us for over $1 million dollars.We continued to honor the autonomy of the victims and protect their privacy by not dragging them into that lawsuit. That was the right thing to do. In 1992, several victims reported the abuser.  He continued to deny it and I testified against him in court. The court used my testimony to verify the abuse and disciplined him in 1993. As a result, he never practiced law again. Three months later the Talbot County Council appointed me to become the first full-time Talbot County Attorney. I held that Office for 24 years, working with both Democratic and Republican members of the County Council to serve the people of Talbot County.I stood with the victims when they chose their privacy because that was right.

“It’s because of the women who inspire and dare to dream big that our future looks so bright.”\nOur country has made progress towards equality for women in the workplace. Women now make up 47% of the workforce, and the number of women in the workforce with college degrees has quadrupled since 1970. But there are still significant systemic barriers that hold women back. In Congress, my legislative priorities to ensure equal economic opportunity for women will include:\nEqual Pay – The numbers don’t lie. In 2016, women working full time in the United States made 80 cents for every dollar that men made. For non-white women, the difference is even greater. Black women made 63% of what white men made, while Hispanic and Latina women made just 54% – this is unacceptable. The underlying social and economic forces contributing to this gap are complex, and require both shifts in cultural norms and government action. That’s why I support the Paycheck Fairness Act, which will provide effective recourse for women who have been victims of wage discrimination.\nPaid Family Leave – The United States is the only industrialized nation that does not have paid family leave. Though some employers do provide paid leave voluntarily, only 15% of the workforce has it. The current policies especially harm women, who bear more of the burden balancing work and family than men do. As Senator Gillibrand said in 2016, many women can’t even get a day off to give birth. Our country can do better and must do better. I support the Family and Medical Insurance Leave (FAMILY) Act, which would establish a national paid leave system.

Working parents, especially single mothers, often can’t afford to stay home with their children and struggle to afford quality childcare. Quality childcare is not just important for a child’s safety and well-being, it’s critical for their future educational development. A landmark study in 1995 showed that children from low-income families will have heard 30 million fewer words by age three than their more affluent peers.\nAffordable quality childcare is particularly a problem in the Sixth District. According to the University of New Hampshire, the average share of family income spent on childcare is 8.8%. But Sixth District families in all five counties spend a much larger percentage of their income on childcare.\nSource: http://www.marylandfamilynetwork.org/resources/child-care-demographics/\nI support the Childcare for Working Families Act, which will ensure that families earning less than 150% of state median income will pay no more than 7% percent of their income towards childcare costs. Furthermore, it will also improve the childcare workforce by providing training and compensation improvements.

“I owe it to my daughters, and yours. This isn’t the time to sit on the sidelines.”\n\nI’m 100% pro-choice. Medical decisions should be made by women and their doctors, not politicians like Donald Trump and Mike Pence. The Trump administration, the Republican Congress, and Republican state legislatures all around the country are trying to eliminate access to reproductive health services. I will fight these efforts and support legislation that ensures women have access to contraception and safe and legal abortion. In Congress, my legislative priorities to protect the right to choose will include:\nFighting Barriers to Abortion Access – Politicians are creating ridiculous barriers for women to access safe and legal abortion under the guise of “protection”. Clinics are forced to close because of these restrictions and women are often forced to drive hundreds of miles to receive the treatment they need. Many states are also passing demeaning waiting period laws requiring women to drive to the clinic two different times for no medical reason. I support the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would stop these laws and put health decisions back into the hands of women and their doctors.\nRepealing the Hyde Amendment – The Hyde Amendment is a provision barring the use of federal funds for abortions services. Millions of women who depend on Medicaid for health coverage are denied access to safe and legal abortion because of this antiquated provision. I will work to repeal the Hyde Amendment in Congress.\nSupporting Planned Parenthood – Millions of women across the country depend on Planned Parenthood for health services like cancer screenings, contraception, STI testing, and safe and legal abortion. I will oppose any effort to defund Planned Parenthood. I will fight for this vital organization.

Violence against women is an all too common problem in the United States. The 1994 Violence Against Women Act was a positive step in helping to give law enforcement the tools they need to prosecute abusers and providing support for victims. But more than two decades later, domestic abuse, sexual assault, and human trafficking remain serious problems – and we need to do more to combat them. In Congress, my legislative priorities to combat violence against women will include:\n• Keep Abusers from Obtaining Guns – Domestic violence affects 1 in 4 women in the United States, and abusers often use guns to threaten or even kill victims. Domestic violence incidents involving a firearm are 12 times more likely to result in death. Keeping convicted abusers and stalkers from obtaining guns is a long-overdue common-sense measure that will save lives. I support the Protecting Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims Act, which would make these prohibitions federal law.\n• Enforce Title IX Sexual Assault Protections – Sexual assault on college campuses is a significant threat to the safety of female students. One in five undergraduate women experiences sexual assault on campus. In response to this epidemic, the Obama administration released new guidelines for how colleges should protect students from sexual assault, which they are legally required to do under Title IX. Unfortunately, Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos have rolled back these guidelines. Congress should act to write the Obama administration’s provisions into law so that we can continue making progress on protecting women on campus.\n• Allow Trafficking Victims to Expunge Convictions – Women who have been victims of forced prostitution and human trafficking often find themselves further victimized by our criminal justice system by laws criminalizing prostitution. These women (including many right here in our district) often find it even harder to get out of prostitution after a criminal conviction, because it’s more difficult for them to find legal employment with a criminal record. To help survivors who have been further victimized by these misguided laws, I support the Trafficking Survivors Relief Act, which would allow women who have been victims of trafficking to have their criminal convictions vacated and their arrests expunged.",0,1,2

In fact, in 2018 I have earned the highest NARAL rating in the 6th congressional district race: ""A""\n\n\nABOVE: Roger's 2018 NARAL Pro-Choice Maryland ""A"" Rating seal, and NARAL's grading/scoring key\nThat’s why in the Maryland House and Senate, I restored more than $9 million in budget funding for women’s reproductive health services, passed a new law banning genetic discrimination (HB29), and established attendance policies to support pregnant and parenting students (SB232). I've passed the new law establishing hiring preferences for Veterans and their spouses (SB245), authored the first bills in America to stand up to the deceptive practices of so-called “Crisis Pregnancy Centers” (HB1146) and requiring 24/7 emergency contraception on college campuses (SB969), and in 2017, I held the Hogan Administration accountable for their failure to protect Marylanders from losing ACA coverage.\n\nABOVE: Roger speaking at National Organization for Women national conference, along with former Delegate and candidate for Governor, Heather Mizeur.\nBut my advocacy for women and struggling families goes far beyond the halls of Annapolis. In 2008, I was selected to serve on a President Obama White House working group for health reform, in which I advised the White House on principles and provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, including banning discrimination based on preexisting conditions. In 2011, I led the fight in Maryland to successfully urge U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to recognize women's birth control and reproductive services as medically necessary preventative health services, guaranteed under the Patent Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nABOVE: In 2012 Roger led a delegation to Capitol Hill, along with then Delegate Susan Lee and NOW activists, to secure a sponsor for the Equal Rights Amendment legislation, which resulted in U.S. Senator Ben Cardin becoming the lead sponsor.\nHaving lived in a group home for a period as a child, I have been a fierce advocate for foster families, and family reunification. In 2016 I joined foster parents and foster youth at a forum on the importance of foster parenting resources, and spoke to the need for second chances for our most vulnerable children. Earlier in my career, as Senior Counsel to Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) and as Legislative Director to Congressman Sanford Bishop (D-GA), I worked at the highest level of the federal government to travel throughout America and the world assisting families who were devastated by terrorism, poverty and natural disasters. During law school, I worked on the United States House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on the Constitution, defending women's reproductive rights from anti-Choice legislation, including the misnamed ""Unborn Victims of Violence Act,"" the Hyde Amendment abortion funding restriction, among others.\n\nABOVE: Earlier in his career, Roger on the Floor of the United States House of Representatives as Senior Counsel to Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, during consideration of her legislation to assist children who lost parents in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. \n\nABOVE: Roger as Senior Counsel to Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee and USAID on a health care mission to Central America. \nThe right of a woman to determine for herself if and when she will start or expand her family is absolutely fundamental. This essential right is under assault in this country, with laws being passed in state legislatures across the country limiting a woman’s right to decide her destiny. In today’s Republican controlled federal government, those in power want to chip away at a woman’s right to choose. We must fight back against these dangerous attacks and protect the progress that we have made. It is also imperative that we not only play defense against these callous attacks. We must work hard to maintain the progress that we have made through generations of organizing, all while still working to expand upon that progress.\n\nABOVE: Roger at the White House, as a member of President Obama's health reform working group,  during development of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).\nLastly, in 2014, when bigotry rose its head in my own community, I rolled up my sleeves to make history by helping to elect the first woman of color in the history of the 19th District. In the General Assembly and throughout my entire career, I have fought to protect the rights of women to make their own health care decisions, and to be treated equally under the law and the Constitution. In Congress, we will continue our efforts to protect and build upon the progress that has been made.\n\nABOVE: Roger with his Senate office staff, including Marice' Morales, prior to her historic election in the 19th District\n\nABOVE: Roger and Marjorie celebrating passage of Maryland's legislation to protect funding for Planned ParenthoodABOVE: Roger standing proud at the 2018 Planned Parenthood gala",0,1,2

It has been nearly 100 years since women won the vote; yet, only 20% of Congressional and only 25% of state legislative seats are held by females. Only 6% of CEOs in Fortune 500 companies are women. Women make up 60% of all U.S. college students; yet, they hold fewer than 30% of all deanships.\nNearly 75 million women, or one-half of the workforce are women. But women are not equally represented in all professions:\n* Only 11% of civil engineers are women; only 18% of computer science majors are women\n* In biomedical research, women comprise only 30% of principal investigators on NIH research grants and less than 20% of tenured senior investigators.\n* In Maryland, a woman still earns on average 82 cents for every dollar a man makes. The pay gap is even worse for women of color and in other parts of our nation.\nThe statistics are endless, but so are our dreams and talents.\nAs a State Legislator, I fought for fair labor policies. I introduced the first bill ever in Maryland for paid family leave. I fought for working families, co-sponsoring Maryland’s sick leave bill each year until it was passed. I co-sponsored the Equal Pay for Equal Work Act and legislation to ensure women-owned firms are equitably considered in state contracts. To help women who wish to or must re-enter the job market, I supported an array of legislation to reduce the cost and increase the quality of child care. I also passed a bill to ensure that computer science courses in our high schools will be taught to women and other groups underrepresented in the field.\nAs your Congresswoman, I will continue to fight for equity for women in the workforce. This means;\n* Passing legislation to ensure equal pay for equal work and strengthen enforcement of anti-discrimination laws.\n* Fighting vigorously for paid family leave (we are the only industrialized country in the world that does not offer this to our citizens and residents.) and flexible work schedules.\n* Supporting legislation to help all families gain access to quality affordable health care\n* Working with the states, starting with Maryland, to expand the availability of PreK education and to protect Head Start programs. These programs give our children an essential early education while reducing child care expenses.\n* Protecting federal regulations to ensure women-owned firms are considered equitably in contract proposals.\n* Improving mentoring opportunities and public private partnerships to ensure that girls and young women have equal access to STEM and other education programs and jobs.\n* Continuing to support NIH, NIST, and other federal research agencies in their efforts to recruit, retain, and advance women in research careers.

Being female can influence the course of a disease or individuals react to prescription drugs. And being female, means having to make very personal health decisions that are just between a woman, her doctors, her family, and her beliefs - whether it be for reproductive health or for treating a devastating condition like breast cancer.\nFor reproductive health, a woman’s reproductive freedoms are an essential human and constitutional right. When we threaten a women’s reproductive rights, we threaten the fundamental equality of women. A woman should never be denied access to reproductive choice or services. Studies shows that it is essential to protect these fundamental rights: Over the last 6 years, abortion rates in the United States have fallen more than 25%. In fact, studies show that countries with the easiest access to birth control had much lower rates and that the number of unplanned pregnancies fall significantly if women can access no-cost birth control.\nAs a State Legislator, I worked to protect a women’s freedom to access reproductive health care. I co-sponsored legislation to establish the Family Planning Program in our health department to ensure the continuity of these health services. I also co-sponsored legislation to eliminate co-pays and co-insurance when purchasing contraceptives and allow pharmacists to prescribe them. Sitting on the Appropriations Committee, I worked to ensure that Maryland became the first state to provide funding for Planned Parenthood should federal funding be cut.\nThis year, I also made a special effort to help women (and men) survive breast cancer. I introduced a bill to make it easier to afford to pay for diagnostic breast exams. Instead of having to pay significant amounts out-of-pocket, women would pay no more than they do for preventive exams. This would help diagnose breast cancer earlier: Maryland ranks 7th in the nation for cancer mortality rates and it is 5 times more expensive to treat breast cancer after it spreads.\nAs your Congresswoman, I would dedicate myself to protecting women’s reproductive health and well-being. This means:\n* Fighting every attempt to defund Planned Parenthood and eliminate funding for Title X family planning services\n* Standing firm against all efforts to reduce insurance coverage for contraceptives\n* Working to ensure that all females (adolescents, women) receive appropriate, evidence-based, information about reproductive health. This includes eliminating requirements to teach abstinence-only education in our schools\n* Opposing any legislation to criminalize health care providers and place unnecessary restrictions on doctors and facilities dispensing contraceptives\n* Opposing any legislation to restrict women who must make a choice on how best to protect their own health\n* Urging federal agencies to redefine preventive services to include “diagnostic” mammograms and sonograms, which are essential to diagnosing and treating breast cancer early

The struggle for human dignity and equal rights for women are the same. We cannot turn our heads and pretend we just do not see that women and girls suffer dramatically from human trafficking, rape and sexual assault, domestic brutality and abuse, and sexual harassment.\nIt is a global, national, and local issue: In the United States, domestic violence is a leading cause of family homelessness and costs our economy billions in lost productivity. Many rape crisis centers across the country have waiting lists while having to let staff go. In Maryland, women had the highest lifetime prevalence of rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner in the country, affecting over 950,000 women. In addition, sexual harassment is finally getting the national attention it deserves, with women daring to break their silence and launch the #MeToo movement.\nAs a State Legislator, I dedicated my career to address these wrongs: At the request of the parents of a young woman who was brutally killed by her boyfriend, I passed several laws, one allowing victims of domestic violence to request offenders use electronic monitoring devices to keep the victims safe. The other law allows offenders to be arrested without a warrant if they threaten victims by violating court-ordered conditions of release.\nI also fought and won extra resources to fund Maryland’s rape crisis centers and strengthen protections for sexual assault survivors and alleged violators on college campuses. I co-sponsored legislation to extend the statute of limitations for rape victims; mandate the appropriate collection and storage of rape kits; and allow women to decide if they want to end parental rights of rapists when a child is conceived without consent..\nAs President of Maryland’s women’s caucus, I launched the Sexual Harassment Evaluation (S.H.E.) Committee. This bipartisan group of women legislators drafted policies to address sexual harassment, many of which became law this year.\nAs your Congresswoman, I will fight relentlessly to protect women’s rights and human dignity. This means:\n* Ensuring the Violence Against Women Act and the federal policies and programs to implement it are never weakened\n* Working to pass the international Violence Against Women Act to stop human trafficking, as many young women who are trafficked come to the United States\n* Fighting the Department of Justice’s inhumane stance that victims of domestic abuse, even those in extreme cases, will not be considered for asylum\n* Renewing and upholding the policies to protect teens from dating violence and sexual assault in college that were rolled back by the Trump Administration\n* Supporting innovative programs to engage men as fathers, educators, coaches, and policymakers to challenge the attitudes and beliefs that support violence\n* Investing fully and fairly all sexual assault and harassment allegations against members of Congress and the President\n* Ensuring that no taxpayer dollars are used to settle sexual harassment or assault cases\n* Making sure that Congress streamlines its own complaint process for staffers and employees and extends discrimination protections to interns",0,1,2

As your representative in Congress, I would co-sponsor this legislation, recently introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Rep. Robin Kelly, which seeks to address the rising rate of black maternal mortality in the US. The legislation would establish standardized obstetric care protocols, better data collection systems, and would extend Medicaid coverage for new moms up to one year after giving birth.\nSupport holistic care models that include alternative birthing options. Doulas, midwives, lactation counselors and paraprofessionals are an underutilized yet growing force in maternal health care. In Congress, I will work to expand access to alternative birthing options, including licensure for doulas, standards for midwives, improvement in postpartum mental health services, resources to reduce disparities in breastfeeding, and the consistent coverage of holistic care by public and private insurance plans.\nReproductive and Sexual Health\n Repeal the Hyde Amendment and Protect a Woman’s Right to Choose. The prohibition on the use of federal funds to pay for abortion services disproportionately impacts low-income women, women of color, immigrants, and young people who rely on Medicaid for their healthcare coverage. In Congress, I will continue to be a fierce advocate for reproductive rights, and push to repeal this ban.\nSupport Comprehensive Sexual Health Education. On the Boston City Council, I have been a champion for providing comprehensive sexual health education in public schools - we cannot be focused solely on abstinence-only education, which has been proven ineffective. In Congress, I will continue to fight for equitable access to sexual health education that is inclusive of LGBTQ+ youth, medically accurate, and promotes healthy relationships. As part of my advocacy, I will co-sponsor the Real Education for Healthy Youth Act, introduced by Rep. Barbara Lee, which would “provide grants for comprehensive sex education to public or private entities that focus on adolescent health and education or have experience with training sex educators.”\nFund Effective Programs for Addressing Teen Pregnancy. I will fight the Trump administration’s efforts to eliminate funding for evidence-based programs like the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP), which “many medical professionals credit with helping to drive the nation’s teen pregnancy rate to an all-time low.”[17] These programs have a real and tangible impact here in the 7th District; the potential loss of federal funding through TPP has forced the Massachusetts Alliance on Teen Pregnancy to close its doors at the end of June.[18] We should be doubling down on funding for these critical, effective programs, not cutting it.\nProtect the Right to Access Complete and Accurate Reproductive Health Care Information. I will vehemently oppose any cuts in funding or requirements that restrict a women’s right to access important information about her healthcare, including information about safe, legal abortions. In Congress, I will protect Title X funding for all family planning centers, including Planned Parenthood. I will support the Women’s Health Protection Act to prohibit restrictive state and federal laws that interfere with reproductive health care services for women, including laws that prevent crisis pregnancy centers operating as comprehensive health care clinics from offering comprehensive information on the full range of health care options available to expectant mothers.
Create and fund a “Survivors Bill of Rights” for all individuals experiencing trauma. The Sexual Assault Survivors Bill of Rights provides critical protections for survivors of rape and other sexual violence. I believe we should build on this concept to create statutory rights for all individuals experiencing trauma, whether that trauma stems from abuse, neglect, fear of deportation, displacement, violence, incarceration or addiction. Left unaddressed, trauma perpetuates cycles of violence, poverty, and other negative outcomes. Survivors should be proactively informed of their rights and connected with available resources, including through dedicated trauma coordinators - support should not be contingent on survivors’ ability to navigate complex systems. In Congress, I will work with survivors, advocates, and community organizations to develop legislation that safeguards the rights of all survivors.\nSupport trauma-informed practices in schools. In a trauma-informed school setting, all adults present - including teachers, administrators, coaches, and others - are prepared and resourced to recognize and respond to students who have been impacted by trauma and toxic stress. As your Congresswoman, I will continue to champion critical investments in trauma informed education, and specifically advocate for additional increases in flexible funding to support innovative local efforts on this front (through the Every Student Succeeds Act Title IV A), and new legislation calling for a trauma informed education toolkit highlighting evidence based approaches jointly developed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Education.\nEnd the criminalization and pushout of girls in school. Gender and race stereotypes, as well as overly harsh discipline practices, play a significant role in girls’ dropout rates, and can lead to involvement with the juvenile justice system. Black and Latinx girls nationally are six times more likely to be suspended from school than their white counterparts, whereas in Boston, girls of color are nearly 11 times more likely to face suspension.[12] When the education of girls is interrupted, there are startling, lifelong economic ramifications for them, their families, and the community as a whole. In Congress, I will push to improve school discipline policies and codify requirements for the U.S. Department of Education to collect and share best practices so that school districts can develop and equitably implement culturally-competent and gender-informed policies.\nSupport Trauma-Informed Care for Children and Families. In Congress, I will co-sponsor the Trauma-Informed Care for Children and Families Act to address the psychological, developmental, social, and emotional needs of children, youth, and families who have experienced trauma, and for other purposes. The bill, first introduced in the House in December 2016 by Rep. Danny K. Davis (D-IL), aims to increase understanding and awareness of trauma and identify best practices for prevention and treatment, particularly for children in urban neighborhoods who have experienced community violence.\nDefund ICE. The actions of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under the Trump Administration - including indiscriminate raids in our communities - are creating an atmosphere of toxic fear and resulting in widespread trauma among immigrants and their families, undermining efforts to create trust and integrate immigrant communities. I believe we need to fundamentally reform our immigration system, beginning with eliminating the detainment and deportation functions within ICE, which have become so destructive to our communities.\nPass legislation to support trauma-informed mental health services for immigrant children who have been detained and/or separated from their families. The long-term consequences of family separation and institutionalization are hard to predict and depend on many factors - like the age of children at the time of separation and the length of time away from family - but pose a potentially significant risk to the health and emotional well-being of the children involved. Children, especially those who have been exposed to trauma and violence, should not be placed in settings that do not meet basic standards for children’s physical and mental health and that expose them to further risk of fear and trauma. In Congress, I would support legislation to provide trauma-informed mental health screening for all children seeking safe haven in the United States, and eliminate immigration enforcement practices that create additional trauma.\nPromote Trauma-Informed Strategies to Prevent and Treat Addiction. More efforts aimed at the prevention of toxic stress and trauma in groups at high risk of exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACE’s) is a primary treatment model for substance use disorders. Prevention programs can help to ensure that generational trauma does not result in the continued abuse of drugs and other substances and the devastation of our families and communities. In Congress, I would promote trauma-informed strategies aimed at preventing and treating addiction. By reducing exposure to adverse childhood experiences, we can dramatically decrease risk for addiction and other health and mental health problems in the long run.
Sponsor legislation to codify guidance issued under Title IX regarding campus sexual assault. In 2011, the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights issued guidance “that spelled out for colleges their responsibility to respond promptly and equitably to reports of sexual violence.”[4] However, in September 2017, the Trump Administration rescinded these critical guidelines[5] - threatening justice for victims of sexual violence on campus. In Congress, I will co-sponsor the Campus Accountability and Safety Act, which would codify requirements for colleges and universities to respond quickly to reports of sexual violence, support survivors, and keep accurate records of sexual violence incidents on campus.\nSupport Paid Safe Days. In Congress, I would co-sponsor the Healthy Families Act to set national standards for sick leave and to provide job-protected ”safe days” to survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Under this legislation, paid safe days would provide time for survivors to recover from or seek assistance related to violence, including legal, medical, and psychological issues that stem from abuse. Too often, survivors of violence must choose between their job and their safety, making it much less likely that they will get the help they need. I would also push to include survivors of human trafficking as a part of the proposed legislation and extend coverage to “chosen family” or family-like relationships absent a legal or biological relative.\nSponsor an amendment to the Fair Housing Act to ensure legal protections for survivors of sexual and intimate partner violence. Current housing protections under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) only apply to domestic violence and sexual assault survivors living in public housing. I would advocate for expanding those protections to the private housing market as well by amending the Fair Housing Act, and I would support the Fair Housing for Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Survivors Act of 2017, which prohibits landlords from discriminating against survivors. To heal, survivors of domestic and sexual violence need access to basic necessities, including housing.\nProtect the rights of survivors of human trafficking. In Congress, I would co-sponsor the Trafficking Survivors Relief Act of 2017 which would allow victims of human trafficking to petition courts to have their criminal records cleared. Millions of individuals in the US and abroad have fallen victim to this modern-day form of slavery, consisting of sex exploitation and human trafficking. As a result, survivors are often charged with crimes like conspiracy, prostitution, money laundering, drug trafficking, or related offenses, making it hard for them to find jobs and housing. I believe that survivors should be freed from further criminalization and would support efforts to fairly and equitably protect the rights and needs of all trafficking survivors.\nCo-Sponsor the Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act of 2017. This legislation is a critical way to combat human trafficking, by investing in services that prevent trafficking of youth before it occurs. Runaway and homeless youth, especially LGBTQ+ youth, are one of this nation’s most vulnerable populations to human trafficking. In Congress, I will co-sponsor legislation to fund and support the access to housing and other essential services for youth at-risk for human trafficking.\nImprove data collection on racial disparities in gender-based violence. Improving data collection will help researchers, policymakers, and service providers develop a more complete understanding of the challenges women face, especially women of color, in violent situations, including instances of intimate partner violence, police brutality, detention, and incarceration. It will also help efforts to develop effective interventions. In Congress, I will push to allocate specific funding to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and other federal agencies to improve data collection as it relates to racial disparities in gender-based violence, including violence against transgender people.
Gender-informed approaches. Women are the fastest growing population of inmates. A majority of incarcerated women are mothers and are the primary caretakers of one or more dependent children. In Congress, I will support legislation to adopt gender-responsive and trauma-informed approaches that address the specific needs of incarcerated women (e.g., family visitation, reproductive and behavioral health care, pretrial services and programming, among others), reduce harm to families, maximize rehabilitation, reunification, and ultimately, successful reentry into the community.\nDisrupt School-to-Prison Pipeline. Gender and race stereotypes, as well as overly harsh discipline practices, play a significant role in girls’ dropout rates, and can lead to involvement with the juvenile justice system. Black and Latinx girls nationally are six times more likely to be suspended from school than their white counterparts, whereas in Boston, girls of color are nearly 11 times more likely to face suspension. When the education of girls is interrupted, there are startling, lifelong ramifications for them, their families, and the community as a whole. In Congress, I will push to improve school discipline policies and codify requirements for the U.S. Department of Education to collect and share best practices so that school districts can develop and equitably implement culturally-competent and gender-informed policies.
When I began my first campaign for the Boston City Council, I made advocacy on behalf of women and girls a central element of my platform. Many people told me that a campaign focused largely on lifting up women and girls couldn’t succeed, but it did, and eight years later, the City of Boston has made important progress on issues of critical importance. Now, more than ever, the 7th District needs a representative in Congress who is steadfastly committed to highlighting the role women and girls play in our communities, addressing the inequities they continue to face, and resisting efforts to roll back critical protections for women’s health and civil rights.\nAs a member of the City Council, I founded - and continue to chair - the Committee on Healthy Women, Families, and Communities. My colleagues and I have the opportunity to listen to women and girls in our community and work on the issues impacting their lives. Their voices are the reason I have worked with young women and school officials to address the discipline policies that lead to disproportionate push out of young women of color; they are the reason I have shared my own experience and worked with survivors of sexual violence to heal and create awareness; it is why I have fought for the intentional inclusion of women in City of Boston contracting; and why I have supported the repeal of archaic statues that impinge on a woman’s right to choose.\nWe must resist, with everything we have, efforts to roll back critical protections like those enshrined in Roe v. Wade, but if we want to build thriving communities and achieve real equality, we must apply the same passion to closing the wage gap, ensuring equal educational opportunity, supporting expecting and new mothers, providing gender-responsive conditions for female inmates, and empowering senior women to age as they wish. That is why it is so important to have an intentional, activist leader in Washington, D.C. who sees these issues as central and work diligently with community to identify the key levers of progress.
Make Equal Pay for Equal Work a Reality. In Massachusetts, women earn 76 cents on the dollar compared to what white men earn. For black and Latino women, the difference is even larger. Individually, states like Massachusetts and New York have had some success in passing legislation to close the pay gap, but impact of pay inequity has lasting impacts on women’s economic security particularly as more women are becoming the sole or primary source of household income. In the 7th, the wage gap cost women workers more than $11,000 a year. In Congress, I will not only support and work to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act but will push to ensure our efforts to achieve equal pay also include reducing disparities in pay across race/ethnicity.\nFight for a Living Wage. Millennials, working families, and seniors in the 7th have struggled with rising inequality and stagnant or falling wages for some time. The effects of which have made rent, childcare, doctor’s visits, and student loan debt harder for working people to afford. Despite increasing levels of experience and education attainment, women comprise a disproportionate number of low-level, low-wage jobs (or jobs that pay under $11 per hour). In fact, women are overrepresented in low wage jobs compared to their In over a decade, the federal minimum has not changed despite rising costs across the board. In Congress, I will co-sponsor the Raise the Wage Act to increase the national minimum wage to $15 and index it to inflation so that it rises automatically with the cost of living.\nPass Paid Leave. It is long overdue for the US to join every other industrialized nation in providing protected paid leave for its working people and families. Women (who make up the vast majority of primary caretakers) account for nearly half of the US labor force, yet only 15 percent of workers overall have access to paid leave, and that percentage is even lower for workers in minimum wage jobs. This year, Massachusetts joined New York, California and a handful of other states in passing paid family leave ─ it’s high time for the rest of the nation to catch up. In Congress, I will sponsor the FAMILY Act, to extend FMLA to all working people to cover caregiving needs beyond maternity leave. National paid leave is a win-win for working people and businesses ─ it will save employer’s otherwise lost revenue while also providing a critical safety net during unexpected life events.\nExpand access to quality, affordable child care. Massachusetts has one of the highest childcare costs in the nation (second only to Washington, DC). For many families and working parents, sending an infant to daycare has become akin to in-state tuition at a public college. With more women in the labor force than ever before, we need to make high-quality childcare affordable and accessible to more families. In Congress, I will fight to raise the income eligibility threshold to cover more middle class families, fund an Early Education and Childcare (EEC) innovation fund to better meet the needs of families with nonstandard work hours, and incentives for businesses and colleges to improve onsite childcare opportunities for working parents and nontraditional students.\nSupport Women and Minority Owned Businesses. Women-owned businesses account for 39 percent of US firms, of which women of color make up nearly half. Reporting shows that due to factors like higher rates of unemployment, greater pay gaps, and longer bouts of unemployment women of color are often left with no choice but to branch out on their own. As a City Councilor, I have worked to support Minority and Women Business Enterprises and will continue champion these efforts in Congress. I will support expanding set-asides contracts for MWBEs through the Small Business Association office, require annual reports to Congress on federal contract awardees, increase opportunities for capital and wealth building for MWBEs, and offer resources and supports for women and minority business owners. We need to support the needs of women and minority business owners to ensure that more of them have access to start not only start businesses, but to succeed.
Protect the Rights of Women and Girl Worldwide. I have always prioritized efforts to support women, families, and those in vulnerable communities and I will take the same approach to when it comes to foreign affairs. I believe the US has a clear role to play on the world stage, its most important being the power to convene. A policy built on forced isolationism and the scaling back our international commitment is in direct contrast with our principles. As I have said from the beginning of this campaign, the solutions live with the people most impacted by these policies. In Congress, I would focus on global issues affecting women and girls, support increase funding for foreign aid, and work to engage our allies and partners abroad. By embracing our mission to protect the dignity and human rights, we will help to improve the lives of women, children, and families, globally ─ while protecting US interests in the long run.\nCreate and fund a “Survivors Bill of Rights” for all individuals experiencing trauma. The Sexual Assault Survivors Bill of Rights provides critical protections for survivors of rape and other sexual violence. I believe we should build on this concept to create statutory rights for all individuals experiencing trauma, whether that trauma stems from abuse, neglect, fear of deportation, displacement, violence, incarceration or addiction. Left unaddressed, trauma perpetuates cycles of violence, poverty, and other negative outcomes. Survivors should be proactively informed of their rights and connected with available resources, including through dedicated trauma coordinators - support should not be contingent on survivors’ ability to navigate complex systems. In Congress, I will work with survivors, advocates, and community organizations to develop legislation that safeguards the rights of all survivors.\nPrevent Campus Sexual Assault. In 2011, the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights issued guidance “that spelled out for colleges their responsibility to respond promptly and equitably to reports of sexual violence.” However, in September 2017, the Trump Administration rescinded these critical guidelines - threatening justice for victims of sexual violence on campus. In Congress, I will co-sponsor the Campus Accountability and Safety Act, which would codify requirements for colleges and universities to respond quickly to reports of sexual violence, support survivors, and keep accurate records of sexual violence incidents on campus.\nSupport Paid Safe Days. In Congress, I would co-sponsor the Healthy Families Act to set national standards for sick leave and to provide job-protected ”safe days” to survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Under this legislation, paid safe days would provide time for survivors to recover from or seek assistance related to violence, including legal, medical, and psychological issues that stem from abuse. Too often, survivors of violence must choose between their job and their safety, making it much less likely that they will get the help they need. I would also push to include survivors of human trafficking as a part of the proposed legislation and extend coverage to “chosen family” or family-like relationships absent a legal or biological relative.\nEnsure legal protections in housing for survivors of domestic violence. Current housing protections under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) only apply to domestic violence and sexual assault survivors living in public housing. I would advocate for expanding those protectections to the private housing market as well by amending the Fair Housing Act, and I would support the Fair Housing for Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Survivors Act of 2017, which prohibits landlords from discriminating against survivors. To heal, survivors of domestic and sexual violence need access to basic necessities, including housing.\nProtect the rights of survivors of human trafficking. In Congress, I would co-sponsor the Trafficking Survivors Relief Act of 2017 which would allow victims of human trafficking to petition courts to have their criminal records cleared. Millions of individuals in the US and abroad have fallen victim to this modern-day form of slavery, consisting of sex exploitation and human trafficking. As a result, survivors are often charged with crimes like conspiracy, prostitution, money laundering, drug trafficking, or related offenses, making it hard for them to find jobs and housing. I believe that survivors should be freed from further criminalization and would support efforts to fairly and equitably protect the rights and needs of all trafficking survivors.
Address Black Maternal Mortality. As your representative in Congress, I would co-sponsor the MOMMA Act, which seeks to address the rising rate of black maternal mortality in the US. The legislation would standardized obstetric care protocols, create better data collection systems, and would extend Medicaid coverage for new moms up to one year after giving birth. I would also support amendments, like those proposed by Sen. Harris, to promote culturally competent care and provide grants to support implicit bias training in medical, nursing, and other allied health education programs.\nPromote Holistic Care Models. Doulas, midwives, lactation counselors and paraprofessionals are an underutilized yet growing force in maternal health care. In Congress, I will work to expand access to alternative birthing options, including licensure for doulas, standards for midwives, improvement in postpartum mental health services, resources to reduce disparities in breastfeeding, and the consistent coverage of holistic care by public and private insurance plans.\nRepeal the Hyde Amendment and Protect a Woman’s Right to Choose. The prohibition on the use of federal funds to pay for abortion services disproportionately impacts low-income women, women of color, immigrants, and young people who rely on Medicaid for their healthcare coverage. In Congress, I will continue to be a fierce advocate for reproductive rights, and push to repeal this ban.\nFund Effective Programs for Addressing Teen Pregnancy. I will fight the Trump administration’s efforts to eliminate funding for evidence-based programs like the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP), which “many medical professionals credit with helping to drive the nation’s teen pregnancy rate to an all-time low.” These programs have a real and tangible impact here in the 7th District; the potential loss of federal funding through TPP has forced the Massachusetts Alliance on Teen Pregnancy to close its doors at the end of June. We should be doubling down on funding for these critical, effective programs, not cutting it.\nProtect Women’s Right to Access Information. I will vehemently oppose any cuts in funding or requirements that restrict a women’s right to access important information about her healthcare, including information about safe, legal abortions. In Congress, I will protect Title X funding for all family planning centers, including Planned Parenthood. I will support the Women’s Health Protection Act to prohibit restrictive state and federal laws that interfere with reproductive health care services for women, including laws that prevent crisis pregnancy centers operating as comprehensive health care clinics from offering comprehensive information on the full range of health care options available to expectant mothers.\nAdvance gender-informed approaches. Women are the fastest growing population of inmates. A majority of incarcerated women are mothers and are the primary caretakers of one or more dependent children. In Congress, I will support legislation to adopt gender-responsive and trauma-informed approaches that address the specific needs of incarcerated women (e.g., family visitation, reproductive and behavioral health care, pretrial services and programming, among others), reduce harm to families, maximize rehabilitation, reunification, and ultimately, successful reentry into the community.
As a sexual assault survivor herself, Ayanna has worked to raise awareness and address this issue throughout her career. And, in the wake of the #MeToo movement, she has also sought to examine sexual harassment policies and procedures within our political institutions, an effort she believes is long overdue in Congress. In fact, her first act on the city council addressed violence and trauma against girls and women.

I believe that women's rights are human rights, and that to achieve true equality for women we must include paid family, medical, and caregiver leave as requirements under the law.

For far too long, women have been unable to come forward to report sexual misconduct due to a hostile work climate, or because of policies that make reporting difficult or detrimental.

Closing the gender pay gap will be a top economic priority, and I’ll fight to end wage discrimination and provide more family supports, like paid family leave and affordable childcare. It’s also past time to tackle safety and equality, not just in the office, but on campus and in the public square. Whether it is equal pay, workplace conduct rules, or physical well-being, we need to do more to ensure that workers are both in safe work environments and treated fairly.

Decisions about reproductive health and abortion must be made by a woman and her doctor, not by politicians. In rural and low-income areas, Planned Parenthood is often the only means for women and men to get reproductive health care.

"264","Messmer, John","John Messmer MO",0,"Summary:\n* Women have had a fundamental right to abortions since the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. This cannot be a right that is ignored or negated in the future. It must be protected by the courts and by Congress.\n* We can agree that abortion should be rare. And Congress can take a role by doing more to reduce unwanted pregnancies. That begins with the encouragement of real sex-education curricula in our schools. It also must include sensible fact-based education regarding contraceptives and birth-control.\n* The federal government needs to do significantly more for pregnant women. This includes making pre-natal and neo-natal care more affordable and accessible. Congress should also do more to remove the unnecessary bureaucratic barriers to adoption.\n\n \nI am pro-choice.\nAmerican women have had a constitutional right to abortion since 1973. This is now a fundamental right that is fully protected by the American judicial system. Such fundamental rights in a civil society cannot simply be negated. And they should not be so cavalierly reversed. Since Roe v. Wade, an entire generation of women have lived with this liberty.\nAnti-choice legislators sometimes fail to appreciate this fact. They abhor abortion to such a degree that they often refuse to appreciate the consequences that laws that restrict reproductive rights have on society – particularly on American women. Reversing this established right would be cruel and counterproductive. That is why we need more legislators that will fight for reproductive rights.\nBut there are as many important similarities between opposing sides in this debate as there are differences. We can agree that abortion should be rare. And we can agree that there is a role that government can play in reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies. And I would hope that we can all agree that among the things that government can do, making criminals of women and their doctors should not be an option.\nWhen it comes to this issue, too many Americans live in a world that no longer exists. Victorian and puritan morals belong in museum displays, not in the decision-making of elected representatives. If we want to lower the prevalence of abortion, we need a strategy that fits today’s realities. Here is a start:\n• Congress needs to encourage REAL sex education curricula in our nation’s schools. Young people will have sex when they’re ready. No lecture from mom or dad or a teacher will stop that. It’s absurd to accept that fact but then NOT educate adolescents with the facts – both biological and psychological – that they need. And the curriculum needs to be grounded in reality – not in a Norman Rockwell version of reality that treats sex as something dirty and sex education as taboo.\n• Adolescents need to learn from this curriculum that they are not abnormal if they choose to abstain from sex. At the same time, however, we need to face the reality that if adolescents do engage in sex that they understand everything they need to know with respect to birth control. Along with fact-based education efforts on birth control should come convenient access to contraceptives. In countries where this combination exists, unwanted teen pregnancies are rare. Allowing old-fashioned prejudices about sex and birth control to dominate this debate is ridiculous and a gross disservice to our children.\n• Congress should compel the states and the Department of Health and Human Services to do more for pregnant women. If women seek abortions because they are unsure of their ability to care for their children, a civil society would want to naturally do more to make carrying a baby to term a more appealing option. Government at all levels can do more to make pre-natal and neo-natal care more affordable and accessible. In addition, more should be done to remove the unnecessary bureaucratic barriers to adoption.",0,0,2

While the Equal Pay Act of 1963 lays out the principle that people must be paid the same amount for the same work, federal courts have interpreted “equal work” so narrowly that an equal pay case can only be won if a man and woman have almost the exact same job.

No one should have to worry about losing their job or income when they are injured or have a sick family member. Many new mothers are forced to make a heart wrenching decision after giving birth of whether to immediately go back to work, or whether to quit their jobs in order to raise their infant. Many mothers who decide to leave their jobs find it extremely difficult to get back into the workforce, and when they do they find that their pay significantly lags behind their male co-workers who did not take leaves of absence.\nWhile working women and their families certainly benefit from organizing and expanding labor protections, they also need to know that their privacy and freedom of choice will not be infringed. I am a strong supporter of a woman’s right to make her own decisions about her body, and would vehemently oppose any unnecessary or excessive restrictions on access to birth control, abortion, or health services. I would support expanding access to family planning and health services to low income areas, and support federal legislation to enshrine a women’s right to choose into law in order to prevent the recurrence of bills like the recent 15-week abortion ban in Mississippi.",0,1,2
"308","Carlson, Robert","Rob Carlson NJ",0,"A popular meme is sometimes true. In this case, it sums up how I feel about Women’s rights: Feminism is the radical notion that women are people.\nWhy would anyone not be a feminist? To not believe in basic fairness or the inherent equality of sexes is basically to be a jerk. Note that equal does not mean the same. We can be cognizant of differences in physiology and still ensure that everyone, irrespective of gender is given equal respect under the law, in the workplace, in the home and in public space.\nThe mark of a civilized society can be measured by how well it treats its women. The most advanced and enlightened societies are those where women have full equality with men. This means equal pay and equal rank for equal work. It means paid time off for family events (for mothers and fathers). It means putting an end to forced marriages and forced pregnancies. It means believing victims of rape and prosecuting rapists– who represent the worst of humanity– to the fullest extent possible. It means putting rapist-enablers on notice too, and killing rape culture in America.\nIt means a woman’s choice on whether or not to give birth is inviolate.\nSexism is the most socially accepted prejudice of all. It is the backbone of fascism and a violent and cruel society, given cover by primitive religions that don’t stand the test of reason or compassion.

You often don't have a seat at the table in deciding the policies that affect your lives: economic policy, healthcare policy, environmental policy, public safety policy, education policy, racial justice, LGBTQ+ rights, and so on. None of these issues are standalone topics. We must recognize the ways they intersect in order to find real solutions to our problems.\nI recognize that as a man, I have unearned privileges in our society. If I have the pleasure of serving in Congress, that power needs to be leveraged for good. I pledge to listen to you, the women of our district, and amplify your voices on Capitol Hill. From my time on the campaign trail so far, here are the issues that you've told me are important, and what I plan to do about them. \n* Reproductive Justice: A woman's right to make all of her own healthcare decisions has been a constitutionally-protected one for over 40 years.  In addition to protecting a woman's right to choose and have control over her own body, I promise to fight for comprehensive reproductive health, access to birth control and preventive care, and to keep vital community healthcare providers such as Planned Parenthood open and well-funded so they can continue serving their communities. Read here about H.R. 771, the Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance Act. I would also work to repeal the Hyde Amendment, an initiative you can read about here.\n* Family Leave: It is past time for the United States to catch up to the rest of the industrialized world and institute mandatory paid family leave for all new parents. This is an economic injustice that unfairly disadvantages women and sets back family's entire financial futures, with low-wage earners being the most vulnerable. Read here about H.R. 947, the FAMILY Act.\n* Equal Pay: The gender-based wage gap, in addition to be fundamentally unjust, also disproportionately hurts working families. Women deserve to be valued for their contributions to their employers in equal measure to the men who work alongside them. We also need to pay attention not only to the women breaking ""glass ceilings"" but also those who are on ""sticky floors,"" by recognizing that women are over-represented in low-wage, low-advancement-opportunity work. In a country where low wages are much more common for single parents than for other U.S. workers., and where single parents are overwhelmingly women, remedying issues of pay disparity will create financial and social stability for generations to come. Read here about H.R. 1869, the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n* Ending Violence Against Women: Since the 2016 election season, a wave of women of our country have come forward to resist the admitted sexual predator and serial abuser and denigrator of women who holds the highest office in the land. Sexual misconduct, manipulation, abuse, domestic violence, and rape are inexcusable. For every high-profile case that makes headlines, there are far too many more that we never hear about. We have a responsibility to lift up the voices of those coming forward, and help them find justice, no matter what party affiliation or political ideology the perpetrators hold. Members of Congress must be held to the highest standard and not be complicit in covering up or normalizing this unacceptable behavior. Read here about H.R. 4396, the Me Too Congress Act.\nThese are just a few of the issues that I've heard when listening to your stories. I always want to know more about what's important to you.

Every woman, regardless of her income level, has the right to make her own decisions about her sexual and reproductive health without government interference.\nMaternity Care and Children’s Health Insurance\nThe United States has the worst maternal mortality rate in the developed world. More than 26 women die per 100,000 live births - and black women are three to four times as likely to die from pregnancy-related causes as their white counterparts. Despite these horrifying statistics, our representatives and the GOP controlled House of Representatives tried to deprive 13 million American women of maternity care when they voted for the AHCA.\nAt the same time, they also let the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) expire. CHIP provides low-cost health insurance to 9 million children and 370,000 pregnant women. 36% of children in New York rely on CHIP and Medicaid for health coverage.\nContraception\nEvery woman has the right to make her own choice about when to start a family. Access to safe reliable contraceptives is the best way for women to avoid unplanned pregnancies and control their futures. President Trump has rolled back a mandate that requires employers to include birth control coverage in our health insurance plans, knowing that access to affordable birth control gives women economic freedom, encourages higher family incomes, and greater university completion rates. This is a direct attack on the 62% of American women who are currently using contraceptives.\nRight to Choose\nIt’s time that our elected officials start trusting women to make the best choices for their own bodies and families. Unlike Peter King I will be a fierce ally for woman and stand up to the unending attacks on our rights. Having the choice to decide when to have a family goes beyond just women’s bodily autonomy, it is the crux of our economic opportunity. With outsized childcare bills and workplaces that often penalize women for getting pregnant, making the choice to start a family is a economic imperative.  \nPeter King voted to make abortion after 20 weeks a crime punishable by prison time, even though most abortions performed at this stage are the outcome of severe fetal anomalies and health risks. He also voted to defund Planned Parenthood and would like to see all abortions made illegal and prosecute doctors who perform abortions.\nPresident Trump signed a resolution that eliminated important protections in Title X, the nation’s family planning and preventative health services program, allowing states to withhold funding from organizations that provide abortion services. This affects millions of Americans – both men and women. Planned Parenthood gives people access to affordable, basic, preventative health care, including cancer screenings, sexually transmitted disease testing, pregnancy tests, and birth control.  Despite the fact that only 3% of the services Planned Parenthood provides are abortions, states can now legally withhold funding from the organization.\nPresident Trump also reinstated the Global Gag Rule, which withholds U.S. funding from organizations abroad if they even mention the word abortion, provide counseling, or referrals – much less provide abortion services with their own funds. While this policy has had terrible effects on family planning, HIV treatment, maternal and child health, and even combating the Zika virus and malaria, it has not reduced the number of abortions.\n",0,0,2

"346","Patel, Suraj","Suraj Patel NY",0,"Now is a powerful time?—?a tipping point?—?in the fight for women’s rights. From the incredible turnouts at both the 2017 and 2018 Women’s Marches, to the wave of #MeToo and #TimesUp stories, our country and the world are awakened to the critical necessity to listen to women, believe women, support women, and to hold each other accountable for our words and actions.\nUnfortunately, the catalyst for this positive change also embodies our culture’s fraught past and imperfect present when it comes to sexism and gender-based discrimination. Trump’s election no doubt emboldened women to speak up about our visions for a more just and equal future, even as his administration attempts to set us back with reckless attacks against trans women and all women’s right to reproductive care. We urgently need fighters who will amplify and support the voices of all women against Trump’s attack on their rights.\nThis remarkable moment in gender equity discourse, and the wide expanse of its reach, must be leveraged as an opportunity to move the needle further towards justice, fairness, and equality. Where we go next depends on our ability to build on this movement, stand our ground through inevitable backlash, and to focus on solutions. This isn’t just about raising our boys to be better men tomorrow?—?this is about men and women working together today to bring real progressive change to the systems that currently leave women at a disadvantage.\nHere’s are a few of the things I’m fighting for —\nEconomic equality is imperative for gender equality.\nTrue equality stems from financial independence. Women in America are still earning only 79 cents for every dollar a man earns. And when we consider the statistics for women of color, the outcomes are worse. In 2016, Public Advocate Letitia James released an analysis of the gender wage gap in New York City’s workforce, which highlights even larger disparities?—?black or African American women in NYC are earning only 55 cents for every dollar a white man earns, while hispanic or latina women are earning only 46 cents, far less than the national average.\nThis persistent inequity is a disgrace, and completely unacceptable. We must bring transparency to salaries by requiring disclosure and reporting of pay, limit requirements for job applicants to provide salary history information, and ensure that employers provide a salary range to applicants in job announcements and advertisements.\nAnother major issue driving our pay gap is the lack of access to boardrooms. Even now, at a time when earnings of Fortune 500 CEOs are at an all-time high, women only account for 5% of the list. Access to capital is also preventing women from reaching their economic potential. In 2017, a dismal 2% of venture capital dollars went to female-founded companies. This staggering gap in financing is preventable and we must focus on solutions. We must make a commitment to invest in companies with women and minority leadership in order to provide fair access to economic opportunity for all, and to drive further economic growth.\nReproductive care must be accessible and affordable.\nWomen all across America, not just in select states, should have full control over what happens to their bodies. The fundamental right to reproductive care has become a left-right battleground, with women losing out every time. This must end.\nTrump has already signed a resolution slashing Title X protections, a family planning program that prohibits states from discriminating against women’s health care providers and ensures millions of low-income Americans have affordable access to reproductive health services, such as cervical and breast cancer screenings, contraception, and regular preventative care. Trump’s plan to institute a “gag-order” on those who provide, discuss, or refer patients to safe and legal abortion services would take us another step backwards by preventing family planning centers like Planned Parenthood from securing critical Title X funding to serve those who depend on their care?—?especially women of color.\nI will fight tooth and nail to protect Title X and expand, not cut, funding to centers like Planned Parenthood. We also need to establish permanent legal mechanisms that prevent any president from going after Title X. A woman’s right to choose should not be compromised by limited access to safe and legal abortion services or counseling to help them make an informed decision.\nHere in New York, our antiquated abortion laws?—?last updated in 1970?—?haven’t met constitutional standards for more than four decades. We must fight to pass the Reproductive Health Act to codify Roe v. Wade into state law and the New York State constitution, bringing abortion out of the criminal code and putting it in the public health law where it belongs once and for all. We must also pass the Comprehensive Contraceptive Coverage Act, requiring insurers to offer contraceptive coverage without co-payment for all New Yorkers.\nEvery person should have the resources and agency to make healthy decisions about their own individual bodies, sexuality, and reproduction. Lawmakers must support, not deny, this right.\nWe must support our families.\nAccess to flexible scheduling, paid family leave, and high-quality child care remains a major hurdle for women and for families across America. The United States is the largest developed country that does not guarantee paid leave to workers, forcing new parents with limited resources to return to work just days after the birth of their children. Once parents return to the workplace, they have few affordable childcare options and often struggle to balance working schedules with time spent with their children.\nThis lack of workplace support for new parents disproportionately disadvantages women, who may be forced to compromise or suspend their careers in order to care for their children. Lower-income women with few options for childcare are especially burdened by this, which further widens existing wage disparities. Offering federal subsidies and tax breaks for workplaces that provide flexible scheduling options, paid family leave, and childcare for their employees will begin to correct the systemic injustices driving the wage gap.\nRising costs put childcare out of reach for millions, and it’s time for every American to have access to care and Pre-K regardless of their income. With the expansion of New York’s child care tax credit for middle class families, I believe we can and should push for New York City to become a model for comprehensive national pre-K programs that support our families, rather than burden them with additional financial and emotional stress.\nThe passing of the Equal Rights Amendment is long overdue.\nThe Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) must be ratified in order to ensure that true equity, including gender pay parity, is protected by law. Guaranteeing that all civil and constitutional rights are fully extended to every American regardless of biological sex or gender identity will empower women with strong legal weapons to fight back on unequal pay, workplace harassment, and reproductive rights\n94% of Americans say they would absolutely support an amendment to the constitution that guarantees equal rights for all individuals regardless of their sex. And support is nonpartisan?—?Democrats, Republicans, and Independents all support this amendment at rates higher than 90%. Perhaps more surprisingly, is that 80% of respondents to the same survey mistakenly believe that this guarantee against discrimination is already in place.\nDespite this broad-based support, the ERA, first introduced in 1932, requires legislative approval from three-fourths of all states (38 out of 50), but has languished in Congress with only partial support since it first passed in 1972. In 2017, Nevada became the 36th state to sign on board. Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Utah, and Virginia are still holding out. I’m committed to being a part of the team that finally carries the ERA across the finish line by securing support from just two additional states.\n",0,0,1

She wants to create a society in which women - which includes Black women, Native women, poor women, immigrant women, disabled women, Muslim women, lesbian queer and trans women - are free and able to care for and nurture their families in safe and healthy environments free from structural impediments. \nReproductive freedom is especially essential for all individuals of marginalized genders, including cisgender women and trans people. Alexandria does not accept any federal, state or local rollbacks, cuts or restrictions on the ability of individuals to access quality reproductive healthcare services, birth control, HIV/AIDS care and prevention, or medically accurate sexuality education. This means open access to safe, legal, affordable abortion, birth control, and family planning services, as well as access to adequate, affordable pre- and post-natal care, for all people, regardless of income, location or education.\nAlexandria is a firm believer in equal pay for all genders. The pay and hiring discrimination that women, particularly mothers, women of color, Indigenous women, lesbian, queer and trans women still face each day in our nation, as well as discrimination against workers with disabilities, is atrocious and must end. Equal pay for equal work will provide families with upward mobility and boost the economy. \nAlexandria is a proponent of labor legislation that reduces the discrimination and exploitation of working women. She believes we should be creating workforce opportunities for caregivers and parents; and stands in opposition to gun laws that allow those convicted of domestic abuse to have firearms and the criminalization of sex work, both of which increase violence against women.

"350","Clegg, Dave","Dave Clegg NY",0,"I fully support a woman’s right to choose. I will continue to support funding for Planned Parenthood, which provides invaluable services for women’s reproductive health at all stages. It is also important that we continue to require workplace health insurance to provide birth control free of charge.

Planned Parenthood provides essential health care services to 2.7 million women, men and young people nationwide, the majority of whom are low-income or live in areas where health care is underserved. For many people, Planned Parenthood is their main or only source of primary care. Nearly four out of ten individuals who received health care services from Planned Parenthood report this constitutes their only health care. Particularly in rural areas, there may not be another option. Millions of women also rely on the agency’s other array of services, including those for cancer prevention and testing for sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS.\n\nI am unequivocally pro-choice and believe Congress must stop its attacks on the agency like the Defund Planned Parenthood Act (H.R. 354). Last year, Cong. John Faso (19th CD) voted with the Republican majority for a permanent ban on the use of federal funds for abortion or health coverage that includes abortion.\nFree Birth Control Under Insurance\nWe need to restore the Obama-era rule requiring workplace health insurance to provide birth control free of charge. Fulfilling a campaign promise to religious supporters, President Trump has rolled back this rule requiring employer-provided health insurance policies to cover birth control methods at no cost to women. Although the purported goal of the rule reversal was to allow any company or nonprofit group to exclude contraception coverage based on religious or moral objections, many health policy analysts say the new rule creates a huge loophole that will now allow any employer to claim an exemption, leaving their female workers to pay the full cost of birth control out of pocket.

There has been a nationwide wave of women coming out to accuse powerful men of sexual harassment, and finally, people are listening and holding these men accountable. This is an important first step. We need to put forward legislation that will protect women in all workplaces. I will advocate for an investigative process for elected officials accused of sexual harassment that involves independent review. I also support legislation that would ensure that House members would be financially responsible for any sexual harassment settlements – not taxpayers.

All women deserve to receive the same pay as their male counterparts. Despite the passage of the Equal Pay Act more than 50 years ago under President John F. Kennedy, women still do not earn wages equal to those of their male peers. It is wrong that women working full-time only earn 78 cents for every dollar a man earns. We need to make sure we are advocating for all women. Black women are paid just 64 cents, and Latina women earn 56 cents, for every dollar earned by white men. I advocate for legislation like the Paycheck Fairness Act that was introduced in a previous session of Congress but was not enacted. This Act would put the burden of justification on employers to explain why someone was not compensated equally. It would also provide funds to start programs that train women in workplace negotiation.",0,0,2

He is a proponent of Medicare for All, and will work to address the disparity in access and quality in many of our rural communities, some of which don’t even have maternity wards, or adequate prenatal and post natal care.\n \nEqual Pay — 55 years after the Equal Pay Act, a white woman is paid 80 cents to a man's dollar, and even less for women of color. First, we must start by raising the federal minimum wage to $15, which disproportionately impacts women. We must also work to end the motherhood penalty that has been shown to affect a woman’s earnings over time, when fathers experience no such penalty. Gareth supports the Paycheck Fairness Act and a number of measures to specifically address the gap for women of color.\n \nPaid Family Leave and Childcare — In the wealthiest nation on earth, 1 in 4 women return to work less than 2 weeks after giving birth, and the vast majority of Americans (86%) have no paid leave. We are one of two industrialized nations (with Papua New Guinea) that does not have a paid family leave policy for new parents or for things like elder and family care, which predominantly still fall on women in our society. Gareth supports a comprehensive federal Paid Family Leave and Childcare programs, and increasing the child care tax credit so it mirrors the actual cost of childcare today.\n \nGun Safety — The presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation makes it 5 times more likely the woman will be killed, and 50 Americans are shot to death each month by intimate partners. Gareth supports closing the “boyfriend loophole,” and a zero-tolerance policy for domestic abusers.\n\nMe Too and Sexual Harassment — No person should feel unsafe, uncomfortable, or exploited in the workplace. For too long, men have been allowed to prey on women with impunity, and Gareth stands with the women and individuals who have been brave enough to share their stories. From ensuring there is equal pay, clear sexual harassment policies, a ban on mandatory arbitration and nondisclosure agreements for sexual harassment claims against an employer, to holding abusers accountable, to not allowing taxpayer dollars to go to settle claims for members of Congress, there are a variety of steps we need to take to stem this epidemic that has been hiding in plain sight for too long.

This is only echoed by the fact that these women are 234% more likely to die after pregnancy, 22% more likely to die from heart disease, and 71% more likely to acquire cervical cancer. This gap in our healthcare system is largely attributed to the fact that healthcare and access to treatment are almost entirely tied to economic standing. This is only worsened by the social inequalities that are stratified over a lifetime such as access and ability to afford healthy food, clean drinking water, access to higher education, and better jobs. To face these problems, we must take a head-on approach to not only healthcare but the inequalities that still stagger in systematic oppression.

In Congress, he’ll take an active role and work directly with business leaders to help reduce this pay gap.\nBut he also knows that supporting working women means creating policy that helps support their careers. In Congress, Ryan will work to pass legislation that requires employers to offer extended paternity leave programs to their employees, so that working mothers get the support they need from their spouses.\nRyan believes we need to do more to increase wages for working families. He fully supports efforts to raise the minimum wage on annual basis and believes that increase should be tied to Cost-of-Living Adjustments. That minimum wage, however, can’t be a one size fits all policy – because living in the 6th District doesn’t cost the same as it does to live in New York City. In the long-term, Ryan is committed to creating an economy where every hard working American has the opportunity to make a living wage.\n

Ryan believes the government’s role in our personal lives should be minimized – and that means that government should not have a say in what women do with their bodies. Government should not be involved in your womb, or your bedroom and he will keep government from enacting policies that would interfere with your right to make your own decisions.\n",0,0,2
"376","Wong, Gerald","Gerald Wong NC",0,"The war on women is being fought on many fronts. It employs many tactics and insidious methods to usurp women’s power over their own bodies. It shows itself in paying women 78 cents and men a dollar for the same work. It shows itself when anyone says a woman cannot be trusted to make decisions about her own health and wellness. It shows itself when a man tries to squelch a woman’s accusation by diminishing her person-hood.\nThankfully, the #MeToo movement is forging ahead to demand justice and better treatment of women in the future. Several famous individuals, as well as several Senators and Representatives have recently been ousted from their positions or forced to resign their offices for sexual assaults, molestations, and rapes. The careless ways that some men have reduced women to ‘locker room banter’ is evidence of arrogance and disrespect. Even Donald Trump bragged about assaulting women with impunity.\nHarvey Weinstein cited his predecessors as teaching him how to coerce women into sexual situations by commenting that “that was just the way things were done in the 70s” and there is truth in that statement. However, when men became selectively deaf after hearing Trump’s Access Hollywood video, women began to decide that something had to change. Women will no longer be ignored or told to go back into the kitchen.\nThe #MeToo movement actually started more than 10 years ago, but it has grown exponentially since Trump grabbed the nation by the p_ssy. No longer will women remain silent in the face of sexual harassment on the job. Now women are speaking out about the things that have been done to them. They are telling their Me Too stories, but many of them have passed the statute of limitations which would have allowed them to prosecute their abusers.\nMany women have decided the Time’sUp! movement is the answer to the question of how to make men stop harassing women in the workplace. Those who have not passed the statute of limitations are prosecuting their assailants. And the assailants are scared. I, Gerald Wong, stand with the women.\nI believe women have the right and the prerogative to choose what they will do with their own bodies. Men are not prohibited from seeking medical assistance for erectile dysfunction, a reproductive issue. Women should not be prohibited from seeking medical assistance with a pregnancy, a reproductive issue. I believe every person has an inalienable right to autonomy over their own body.\nAs Congressman, I will stand up for women’s issues. That includes the right to choose.\n\n",0,0,2

Yet, the very same officials that shout these ideologies turn around and try to tell a woman what she can and cannot do with her body based on their own personal beliefs. I cannot think of a way in which government is more involved in your life than if they are telling you what to do with it.\n            If a member of congress tries to make it their job to dictate to women how she should treat her body based on their personal religious beliefs, they needed to be kicked out of office. Decades ago the supreme court ruled that women have the right, under the fourteenth amendment, to have access to safe and legal abortions. There is no reason to begin to infringe upon or reduce this right as we know it today.\n            Our number one interest in regards to abortion is to first protect women’s health and their right to choose. I believe the government should stay out of what any woman may choose to do. Instead of limiting access to abortions and forcing women into difficult, sometimes life threatening decisions, we need to ensure the access to abortion is expansive and safe.\n            I also respect that everyone has his or her own moral, sometimes religious views on the issue and these opinions are allowed and accepted so long as they do not actively attempt to deter women from their right to choose.

It’s not a right that must be given; it is a right that exists. But progressive legislation is required to protect and guarantee that right. The Title X Family Planning Program enacted in 1970 should be expanded to provide more and better family planning health care to women.

That shaped my career, and also the man I am today. As a young lawyer, I worked for the Philadelphia Women’s Law Project on a successful challenge to Pennsylvania’s restrictive anti-choice law. Fifteen years ago, my wife, Christy, and I inherited my family’s foundation, the Wallace Global Fund, an international nonprofit organization dedicated to family planning and abortion rights worldwide.\nChristy and I have rededicated the foundation more broadly to advancing women’s rights, fighting against harmful patriarchal practices like child marriage and female genital mutilation, promoting women’s economic empowerment through access to microenterprise loans, educating investors about the value of investing in women-run businesses, and promoting access to family planning and girls’ education — which is critical to ensuring that women have agency over their own bodies and can participate fully in society.\nAs your representative in Congress, I will rely on my decades of experience as a zealous advocate for the rights of women and girls to implement meaningful policy solutions that will improve the lives of women and families right here in the first district.\n* Equal Pay for Equal Work: Women still earn around 80 cents to a man’s dollar for the same work, and the statistics are even worse for women of color. Instead of rolling back equal pay protections, like Donald Trump did last year, I will work to ensure that women are compensated fairly. It’s not just the right thing to do; it makes economic sense. If women were paid fairly, the American economy would see more than $500 billion in additional economic activity and millions of families would be lifted out of poverty.\n* Reproductive Rights: The rights of women to make their own reproductive healthcare decisions is constantly under attack. Through my decades of work as an advocate for global family planning services, and as a proud parent myself, I know how important it is to protect the rights of women and families to make their own healthcare decisions. As your representative in Congress, I will support the full funding of Planned Parenthood for family planning and reproductive health services, and I will fight against dangerous, restrictive laws that impede on the ability of women and their doctors to make the best choices.\n* It’s on Us: We must actively work to end rape culture and combat sexual violence and harassment everywhere — in the workplace, on college campuses, in the military, and even in the halls of Congress and the White House. I will work with leaders in all levels of government to ensure adequate resources to combat sexual assault and stronger protections for survivors of sexual violence. What I won’t do is protect perpetrators of sexual harassment or sexual violence — no matter their position, their politics, or their past. It is outrageous that Paul Ryan and this Congress have allowed taxpayer dollars to be used to make secret payments to settle claims of sexual harassment against Members of Congress. And it is ridiculous that after so many women have accused Donald Trump of sexual misconduct, our Republican Congress and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick cannot muster the courage to condemn his behavior, let alone take any action.\n* Supporting Working Families: Out of 41 industrialized nations around the world, the United States is the only one that does not guarantee paid parental leave. We also have millions of workers who are faced with impossible decisions each day: go to work sick; leave a sick loved one home alone; or risk losing their job. This has to change, but first, our leaders and our priorities must change. Instead of spending trillions on tax cuts for the rich, I will work to implement common-sense solutions that support working families, such as paid parental leave, expanded sick and family medical leave, and policies that make childcare more affordable.\nWhen we empower women and families with policies like this, we are empowering our next generation of leaders and ensuring that they have the right to self-determination in this world. This is powerfully resonant with me because of my parents’ passion and because of my own daughters.\nThe voters of Pennsylvania’s First Congressional District deserve a Representative who is a lifelong progressive Democrat, with decades of experience actually working for women’s rights and empowerment.

The focus should be on enforcing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to combat discrimination and sexual harassment in our workplaces. Kevin also believes that we should hold colleges and universities more accountable under Title IX and Department of Education federal funding requirements to ensure that there are real protections for victims of campus sexual assault in place.",0,0,2

"442","Sheehan, Molly","Molly Sheehan PA",1,"Women deserve agency over their own lives. Conservative opinion has brought about legislation that takes our voice out of conversations, often times during conception as well as implementation, that determine what we can and cannot do with our bodies. As a result, we have teetered over the line that the Fourteenth Amendment clearly designates as a protection of our rights. It is my goal to persist as a voice for women and to advocate for our right to equal pay for equal work and policies that prevent maternity from interfering with women’s careers.\nPaid family leave for everybody is essential to shrinking the wage and career gaps between women and men and promoting healthy families with both mothers and fathers as involved parents. Children benefit when both parents have caregiving responsibilities and are enabled to serve as reliable caregivers. When we prevent both parents from taking paid leave, women are forced to take unpaid leave, harming their careers and often leaving the workforce and discriminated against in hiring. Men are forced to increase hours and spend more time away from their children. As a result of this paradigm, families suffer and women lose economic agency.\nI believe that women also deserve unfettered access to birth control and the right to choose so that they can make decisions about their own bodies and families. These decisions should be made in the clinic between a woman and her provider, not the legislature by suited men with no knowledge of women’s health.\nTragically, laws and protections for women in cases of domestic violence and human trafficking also fall short of acceptable in my view. It’s imperative that Congress sets the standard of prosecuting these horrendous acts as serious crimes in which the victims, in both cases, are protected from prosecution and provided with the support services crucial to enabling their long and difficult road to recovery.

I believe in a woman’s right to choose for her own body and that this choice is foundational to women’s rights generally. I also believe abortion rights is an issue that has been improperly used to divide otherwise similarly compassionate people. The role of the U.S. House of Representatives is to craft legislation that will enable better access to contraception and family planning and make sure that no woman has to choose between an abortion and poverty.  I fully support a woman’s right to choose. Part of the right to choose is the right to choose life, but women are bombarded with hurdles due to ill-conceived legislation that keep them from making a decision with their own gynecologist and getting proper care in a timely fashion. Obstructionist legislation is unconstitutional and needs to be put to an end. The key to lowering abortion numbers and improving women’s health is to get the government out of the clinic and provide better support to families with young children.  I will fight to secure adequate sex-education and family planning services in conjunction with a stronger fight for social and economic justice that will provide an environment whereby the need for, and utilization of abortions, will be diminished through increased women’s agency.\nScience - a system or method reconciling practical ends with scientific laws\nI invite you to join me in the effort to reconcile the needs of the PA 5th with pragmatic scientific solutions.

Restricting the sale or possession of guns to perpetrators of domestic abuse and those who have protection orders against them will protect American women and their families. Gun owners who have protection orders filed against them should be required to turn over their firearms to law enforcement until a judicial determination or mental health assessment is made.

In order for women's voices to be heard, for healthcare policy to be inclusive and for the #MeToo dialogue to turn into meaningful policy reform, women need a seat at the table.

 As a country, we have made progress in closing the opportunity gap for women, but there is still work to be done. In order for us to continue this progress, women need a seat at the table. Women’s voices should not just be present when discussions take place or policies are being written regarding workplace harassment, pay equity, and reproductive healthcare: women’s voices should be leading those discussions.\n \nMary Gay Scanlon has fought to empower women and girls in the classroom, in the workplace, on the field, and in our democratic process throughout her personal and professional life. Under the Trump Administration, a fully fledged assault on women’s rights is taking place and strongest defense we have is ensuring more women are elected to office. In Congress, Mary Gay will continue fighting to ensure that our government doesn’t turn the clock back on the progress we’ve made for women, everywhere. Mary Gay will introduce and support policies including, but not limited to:

Research shows that when women have control over their reproductive health, they have greater success in both career and life. Access to affordable healthcare in a 21st century economy is non-negotiable. Mary Gay Scanlon will fight to make sure that women’s healthcare is no longer a footnote in healthcare policy, but at the forefront.\n \nMary Gay will fight to require public and private health insurance companies to make birth control, annual pap exams, prenatal and post-natal care affordable. Mary Gay will also work to expand access to maternal healthcare, as women of color and in rural areas are three times more likely to die during childbirth than white women due to inadequate care.

Mary Gay will fight to require health insurers to make birth control affordable and accessible for all women. Research shows that when women business-owners have access to birth control, they have more control over their career trajectory and the growth of their business. Mary Gay will oppose any step to restrict access to abortion care, including standing firm against attempts to defund Planned Parenthood.

Almost every woman in the workplace has experienced harassment, wage discrimination, or other gender-related mistreatment. Mary Gay Scanlon is running for Congress because our mothers, our daughters and our sisters deserve better.\n \nFrom Hollywood to the halls of Congress, the past few months have shown that our culture needs fixing. Mary Gay knows that no law alone can do that, but it starts with holding our elected officials, including our president, accountable for their own sexual misconduct and silence. In Congress, she will fight so that women are heard, seen and valued.

Mary Gay has worked on behalf of women fighting for equal pay and, in Congress, will work to eliminate the obstacles facing women to equitable pay and benefits.\n \nFor the past 15 years, Mary Gay has been the leader of a national pro bono program that advocated for women, seeking equitable benefits and pay for female athletes, including the U.S. Women’s Hockey Team in their strike in 2017 and the U.S. Women’s Soccer Team. In Congress, Mary Gay will support legislation to ensure Equal Pay for Equal and ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.

Given the central role that women still often play in child care, the provision of affordable, accessible, quality child care and universal Pre-K are important to both children’s development and women’s economic opportunity. In order for us to close the wage gap and reduce the cycle of poverty, we need to create pathways to sustainable employment. Reliable, affordable childcare is a pathway to economic independence for women, men and families.  \n \nFor more information on these policies see the Education and Jobs issue pages.

Mary Gay knows that protecting reproductive health care is vital to economic and personal success for women.

We must do more to address sexual harassment and assault, starting with Congress and President Trump.

Even after myriad factors are adjusted for, including differences in hours worked and time taken away from career pursuits to devote to family, pay equity remains an issue of basic fairness. Earlier this year there were protests at one of the district’s major retail outlets over the fact that women were being paid less than men. The jobs at issue were performed by hourly workers, and the differences in pay could not be accounted for by job title, responsibilities, negotiating salaries, career ambition, or any of the factors typically cited to explain differences other than simple discrimination.\nThe Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 make gender discrimination of this kind illegal. But filing complaints with the Equal Pay Act or Title VII of the Civil Rights Act often does not result in wrongs being righted. Under current law it is too easy for employers to claim that factors other than sex account for pay differences: one employee had more experience or training, or was a better salary negotiator, for example. Workplace policies that discourage, or even prohibit, employees from comparing their compensation are unacceptable. Under current federal law such policies are illegal, but most workers don’t know that, and they continue to feel pressure to refrain from doing so.

 In Roe v. Wade the US Supreme Court established a framework for access to abortion that has been in place for more than four decades. Yet at both the federal and state levels there have been persistent efforts to restrict abortion in ways that are clearly inconsistent with that decision. And state legislatures continue to test the boundaries.\nAbortion is an ethical dilemma: a situation in which there are competing interests that must be weighed and valued against each other. Yet people on the two sides infrequently acknowledge this, one side insisting that the only interests that matter are that of the unborn child in surviving to term and that of the state in protecting that life, while the other side insists that the only interest to consider is that of a woman in controlling her own body, making decisions with the advice and guidance of her doctor without state interference. By definition, an ethical dilemma requires that the competing interests be weighed and valued, and the resolution must be determined through consensus: in this case societal consensus. Many public opinion surveys have told us Americans are, by and large, comfortable with the Supreme Court’s framework in Roe v. Wade, and they want to preserve the status quo, opposing new restrictions.\nI believe this status quo must be preserved, and efforts to impose new limitations must be turned away in the legislatures and the courts.\nAccess to contraception and other women’s health services are under continued threat by Republican legislators who want to allow policies by employers and health insurance companies that refuse to pay for these services, and who attempt to cut off funding through federal avenues, including Medicaid payments, for organizations that provide women’s health services, such as Planned Parenthood.\nPlanned Parenthood is maligned as an abortion mill, when abortion services are a small proportion of the organization’s work, and pregnant women are provided counseling about the entire range of options available to them. Planned Parenthood provides vitally important services that many women need and can get nowhere else. The current Congress and Administration have been perceived as an existential threat to Planned Parenthood, resulting in increased private donations to support the organization. But while this is a welcome sign of the way Americans value Planned Parenthood’s contributions to women’s health, federal funding must be preserved – and enhanced. Planned Parenthood is a critical source of a range of healthcare for women, including pregnancy prevention, treatment of sexually transmitted infections, and early detection of cancer.

I support restoring federal funding for women’s health organizations, such as Planned Parenthood, which provides essential care to women of all races, zip codes, and socioeconomic backgrounds.  We need to go further and provide women with free contraception of their own choice. I am pro-life (with exceptions for rape, incest, women under the age of consent and women whose lives are endangered by pregnancy), but regardless of my personal views, Roe v. Wade is the law of the land, and I respect and follow the law.  I will not support or vote for unconstitutional legislation like the unconstitutional “Personhood” bill introduced in the South Carolina Senate and narrowly defeated at the end of the recent legislative session. Some have expressed concern that because I am pro-life, I would go to Congress to overturn Roe v. Wade. Congress cannot overturn Roe V. Wade.  Roe is constitutional law, and Congress cannot change the constitution with a statute – that would be unconstitutional – and as I stated above, I will not support or vote for the unconstitutional legislation.\n* Equal Pay for Equal Work.  Women deserve equal pay for equal work.  As a member of Congress, I will vote for federal legislation demanding exactly that.  If you are doing the same job, you should be getting paid the same amount.\n* Violence Against Women Act.  Unfortunately, South Carolina has one of the highest rates of domestic violence against women of any state in the country.  This has to change. I support the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and will work to ensure that the Office of Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice is properly staffed and funded and lead by an appointee that believes enthusiastically in its mission, not someone appointed by the Trump administration to make the office ineffective.  I will also work to find a way to provide federal remedies for victims of gender-motivated crimes and to restore the right of women to sue their attackers in federal court, a right that was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in U.S. v. Morrison.\n* Me Too.  For too long, men in positions of power and authority over women have felt entitled to use and abuse the women they work with, and our society has been too ready to accept powerful men’s denials and too ready to discourage women from resisting abuse and standing up for themselves.  The Me Too movement has changed the tide in the right direction. I strongly support the Me Too movement and will stand with women looking to end the abuse of men in power.",0,1,0

This battle should have long been over.  I will push to ensure that equal work receives equal pay, and will pursue policies that combat discrimination against women in the workplace. \n\n     I will work toward expansion of medical leave laws that allow families to feel secure, whether they suffer from an illness or are blessed with a child.  I support the protection of civil and marriage rights for all Americans, and reject prejudice of every description. ​\n\n     In addition, more laws are needed to protect women against violence.  Increasing legal protections for women and girls, along with allocating national resources for programs that help reduce domestic violence rates are of utmost importance.  I support prohibiting the possession of firearms for people who have any protective order placed against them, as well as increasing federal funding for programs that provide services to those exposed to violence or abuse.\n\nI support closing the Boyfriend Loophole. Federal law prohibits the purchase\nand possession of firearms by convicted abusers, however, due to the federal\ndefinition of “domestic abuse”, this prohibition does not take effect if the couple\nwas not married and has no children together. The majority (90+%) of women\nmurdered are murdered by someone they know, and firearms are the most\ncommon weapon used. Given these statistics, closing the Boyfriend Loophole is\ncrucial to protecting victims of abuse from further harm.\no I support prohibiting the possession of firearms for people who have any\nprotective order placed against them. Current federal law prohibits\nindividuals from buying or possessing firearms if a “final protective order” has\nbeen issued against them. However, there is no prohibition on firearms for those\nwho have temporary protection orders placed against them. There is currently a\nbill in the Senate (S.2044) that aims to close this loophole, but it has yet to\nbecome law. This particular bill is named the “Lori Jackson Domestic Violence\nSurvivor Protection Act” after a Connecticut woman who was shot and killed the\nday before a hearing that would have required her estranged husband to\nrelinquish his firearms.\no I would propose a national version of the Defending Childhood Initiative.\nThe best way to fight domestic abuse is to prevent it from happening in the first\nplace. In 2010, Attorney General Eric Holder launched the Defending Childhood\nInitiative as a pilot program in eight US cities. The focus of this program was to\nprovide services and counseling to children who had been exposed to violence\nor abuse in order to mitigate its effects and spread awareness about the\nproblem. A 137-page report on the outcomes of the program is available\nthrough the National Criminal Justice Reference Service. Using the lessons\nlearned and recommendations from this report, a national version of this\nprevention program should be developed.\nI would propose allocating national resources for programs such as the\nCDC’s “Coaching Boys into Men” program. The Coaching Boys into Men\nprogram was a CDC funded, three-year test program (ending in 2012) that took\nplace in sixteen high schools in Sacramento, CA. This program consisted of\ncurriculum designed to discourage violence against women and girls, and the\nresults were extremely promising. Students who participated in this program\nwere found to be more likely to report domestic violence, more likely to\nintervene, and less likely to perpetrate domestic violence. Modeling a national\nprogram based on the success of the CBIM program and/or providing grants or\nother resources for similar programs could be effective ways to reduce domestic\nviolence rates.\no I would increase VAWA funding for victim support services and for response\ntraining for police officers and family court judges. The 1994 Violence\nAgainst Women Act (subsequently reauthorized in 2000, 2005, and 2013) was a\ncomprehensive act that focused on preventing sexual assault and domestic\nviolence, funding victims services, funding community crime prevention efforts,\nthe training of law enforcement and other officials, the creation of the first\nfederal anti-battery law. Increasing VAWA funds and resources could potentially\nincrease the impact and effectiveness of this act. Additionally, increasing and\nimproving the training that police officers and family judges receive could\nimprove their ability to adequately respond to and handle situations involving\ndomestic violence.",0,0,2

Reproductive Rights are central to healthcare, and must not be infringed.\nPRO-CHOICE / PRO-ABORTION\nHome / Pro-choice / Pro-abortion\nWe must change the language around abortion and acknowledge that safe and legal abortions are critical to women’s health and reproductive rights. For this reason, I prefer to say I am pro-abortion.\nBeing pro-abortion does not mean I advocate for everyone getting abortions. A good analogy is being pro-chemotherapy. I do not advocate for indiscriminate use of chemotherapy on patients, but I believe it should be fully accessible when it is necessary as a medical procedure. In the same way I support chemotherapy for cancer patients, I support abortions for those seeking them.

Proper sex education and access to contraception are the ONLY successful ways to prevent abortions. This is backed by empirical evidence. Sex happens and should no longer be shamed. Comprehensive sex education is a proven way to reduce abortions and unwanted pregnancies, lower the incidence of sexually transmitted infections, and promote healthy awareness of one’s sexuality.

Mothers’ lives matter just as much as their children’s. Texas leads the nation in maternal mortality rates, especially among minorities. Abortions and reproductive care are vital to saving mothers.\n

Federal dollars do not fund abortions due to the Hyde Amendment. Planned Parenthood offers sex education and empowers people to make better health choices with facts, statistics, and preventative health services. Measures must be taken to end the Hyde Amendment because abortion restrictions are directly correlated with negative maternal health outcomes. Here in Texas, we have a higher maternal mortality rate than anywhere else in the industrialized world, and this is directly caused by recent anti-choice legislation.

"545","Kopser, Joseph","Joseph Kopser TX",0,"Unwavering Support for Women\nFor too long, too many politicians in Congress – Democrats and Republicans alike – have treated women’s constitutional rights, economic opportunity, access to healthcare, and societal status as a bargaining chip in negotiation. In Congress, my bedrock support for women, their health, their opportunity, their choice, and their freedom will never be a bargaining chip. It will be a foundational principle on which I base my representation of Texas 21 and my votes on complex legislation.\n\nThroughout my adult life, I have sought at times – through my experiences in the Army, in business, and in philanthropy – to be blind to gender as a barrier to opportunity. But as I have grown older my experience has been that barriers aren’t removed by being blind, they are removed by being consciously addressed. In the Army, I was insistent that all of my soldiers were led as equals, whether that be on the battlefield in war, in the bureaucracy of the Pentagon, or in the comfort of an Army post. In business, I was a consistent concern for HR because of my insistence that my company make a conscious effort towards gender parity amongst my staff. When we couldn’t get the resumes to reach that parity, my wife and I committed our own funds to invest in ensuring the next generation of young girls both had and sought opportunities in STEM. What we learned through these experiences was that we needed to capture the minds of young women in fourth and fifth grade before societal stereotypes influence their biggest dreams, and I hope that our investment will spur the STEM leaders of tomorrow.\n\nIn Congress, I will do my best to view policies through the lens that my wife, my daughters, and other strong women in my life have helped me develop in my decades of living. I will always consider the impacts of legislation on women, not as a special interest group but in the context of their unique needs as the majority of the population – deserving of equal opportunity, treatment, and support – that has been historically and institutionally marginalized. I will continue to learn from and be led by women around me who share their stories, experiences, and concerns.\n\nProtecting a Woman’s Right to Choose\nI fully believe, affirm, and support a women’s right to choose. This is a fundamental right, anchored in privacy and personal domain, and should never be influenced by politicians. The notion that any politician – Democrat or Republican, man or woman – should have any say over what a woman can and cannot do with her body is preposterous. In Congress, I will stand in strong opposition to bills that attempt to leverage women’s constitutional rights or that attempt to roll the clock back on women’s health and safety.\n\nPlanned Parenthood Funding\nPrevention\nTexas has proven to be a case study in the need to protect funding for the vital healthcare services that Planned Parenthood provides its patients. The heartbreaking stories of healthcare deserts that have been created by Planned Parenthood clinics being forced to shut down, when at times they were the only accessible opportunity for prenatal care, gynecological care, oncological care and other basic needs, could fill a book. The most devastating of these stories has been Texas’ meteoric rise to the worst ends of maternal death rates.\n\n\n\nThere’s no more basic tenant of service in government than protecting the health and well-being of one’s constituents and funding for Planned Parenthood clinics is one of the most basic ways I can fill this fundamental role. I will be a champion of funding for Planned Parenthood clinics and all of the services it provides to so many disadvantaged families in this country.\n\nAccess to Birth Control\nBirth control saves lives and the attack on access must end.\n\nI will advocate for expanded and more strongly protected coverage through the insurance markets. We must ensure that not only do we keep birth control accessible to the populations that need it, but that it also remains to them as well. Often times, availability over the counter can mean that some of the communities that most vulnerable, and would most benefit from universal access, are priced out of receiving the care they need.\n\n\nThis will allow for greater freedom for families, not only from the burden of having to take responsibility for paying repeated co-pays to obtain a birth control prescription, but also from worry whether the insurance plan covers such a prescription, or adequately pays for it. Moreover, it will free millions of women from having to make the often excruciatingly difficult choice of whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.\n\nI will fight any legislation that furthers the confusing and troubling efforts by Republicans to condemn abortion, while at the same time trying to block women’s access to measures shown to reduce this practice and empower women in their control of family planning decisions, like birth control.\n\nFamily Leave\nThe U.S. is the only developed country in the world that doesn’t offer families the support they need in the form of paid parental leave. In Congress, I will fight to change the perception of paid family leave from a luxury to the modern necessity it is for many families today.\n\n \nWe’ve ignored this issue long enough, and it’s time to do right by working American families. I’ll advocate for a guaranteed 12 weeks paid leave of at least two-thirds of current wages for all working Americans to care for a new child or seriously ill family member, or to recover from their own health scares.\n\nMoreover, I’ll ensure this paid leave comes at no additional cost to businesses—including small businesses—by proposing a tax reform policy that makes sure the wealthy are paying their fair share to support the working families that are integral to the strength of our economy. I will recoup some of these funds by repealing the irresponsible tax cuts that Congress just passed.\n\nWIC & SNAP\nWIC & SNAP are not bargaining chips; they are essential parts of the social safety net. They form the basic tenets of a government’s social contract with its citizens and are a key indicator of how we as society take care of the least among us. They are essential, precious investments in our family, our friends, our neighbors, and more broadly our citizens. It will always be a priority of mine to protect and strengthen these programs that are vital to so many women, single parents, young children, and families.\n\nEqual Pay for Equal Work\nPay equity is a fundamental, common sense tenet of fairness in a modern society. This should be uncontroversial and it is inexcusable that we are still in a place in society where women make $0.77 on the dollar, and more egregiously, African American women make $0.65 on the dollar and Latina women make $0.59 on the dollar. In Congress, one of my main priorities will be ensuring that we institute accountable, verifiable, trackable incentives to bring a reality to pay parity.\n\nOpen Opportunity\nThrough the adventures that have filled my professional career to date, I have experienced jobs and opportunities that society has wrongfully geared towards men. At every opportunity, I insisted on making the Army, and later entrepreneurship in the STEM field, an open, enticing, and reachable opportunity for anybody who aspires into those ranks. I will seek to leverage my platform in Congress, and in the broader region of Central Texas to continue that insistence that opportunities are open for all. Where there is capacity, I will bring down federal dollars to support programs specifically geared towards creating opportunities for women and young girls. Where there is not that opportunity, I will use my voice as a means to echo and otherwise codify the furthest reaches of their dreams.\n\nRaising the Minimum Wage\nWhen Congressman Lamar Smith was first elected to Congress in 1986, the minimum wage was indeed a wage for those entering the job market and seeking to gain experience in their first professional roles. The reality today is much different: adult women make up 60% of minimum wage earners and 80% of single parents earning minimum wage are women. I will fight with great fervor to increase the minimum wage to a living wage: $15 per hour and indexed to inflation. This is one of the simplest things we as a society can do to lift millions of Americans out of poverty.",0,1,2

And I view this as government intrusion into women's decision-making and into their private lives.\n\t\nWomen should have unrestricted access to birth control whenever they so desire it.  While abortion is an issue as controversial as gun control, being pro-life does not give one dominion or responsibility over someone else's life choices.  If such were the case, the “responsibility” would certainly not end after the duration of the pregnancy alone.  Many women who seek abortions are impoverished or live on subsistence wages, making access to even normal birth control aids out of their budget.  Far too many times, I've seen the same petitioners for pro-life laws disappear after the birth, and instead falling on more typical legislative pursuits such as cutting the social welfare net to pay for tax cuts to big business or the wealthy.\n\t  \n\t  There's nothing pro-life about allowing an indigent child in a forced but unwanted birth to live a life without adequate nutrition, healthcare or possibly even a roof over their head.  We can't turn control over our individual lives over to the government without abdicating our freedom.

Economic disparity is one of the most pressing issues facing the country today.  From 1948 to 1973, workplace wages came close to keeping pace with productivity and profits.  Beginning in 1974 and continuing through today, productivity and profits have increased at a rate 5.9 times that of workplace wages. Per the Economic Policy Institute, the average executive pay ratio in America is 271:1 to the average worker's wage.  Compare that to Japan where the same ratio is currently only 11:1.  CEO pay has risen 937% since 1978 – more than 70% faster than the rise in the stock market and dwarfing the 11.2% hike in the average worker's pay in the same period!  More than any other factor, this is the prime reason the middle-class is dying a slow death.  And without a middle-class, our marketplace suffers, eventually meaning the economy suffers.\n\nThe wage gap between female and male employees is also an ongoing chronic problem.  Per the Census Bureau, women on average earn 79% of what men do for the same job!  For minority women, the gender pay gap is even worse, with black women earning 60% and latino women earning 55% of what white men earn for the same job.  The failure of the Equal Rights Amendment to be ratified into the Constitution is glaringly obvious as there is no solid reason for such earnings disparity for the same job to exist.

Ban Ki-moon\nI can't believe that I have to write about the necessity of protecting and expanding Women's Rights in the year 2017. The election in November 2016 illustrated that this fight is far from over, and that we must remain ever-vigilant. We continue to see images of rooms full of men developing laws and crafting policies that affect women. We continue to hear about attacks on women's rights in state legislatures across the country. \nThis. Is. Unacceptable. \nOur government must not just represent us. It must be representative of us. The United States Congress consists of fewer than 20% women. Women account for only 20% of the country's mayors. State Legislatures are composed of only 25% women. We must change this. \nIf you believe that women's voices should be heard, give women the microphone. If you believe that women should be involved in policy-making, put women in the rooms where the policies are being made. If you believe that women should be involved in writing legislation, elect women to the offices responsible for writing laws. \nIn addition to electing women to legislative bodies, we must:\n* Defend women's reproductive rights and provide access to free and low-cost contraception.\n* Advocate for equal pay for equal work and economic justice in wages, pensions, and earnings.\n* Address and eliminate sexual assault and other forms of violence against women.\n* Secure equality for women through the Constitution by ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment. \nWe owe it to our mothers and grandmothers who fought before us, and to our children and grandchildren who will come after us, to continue to fight for equality for all women. \nIn 1973, the United States Supreme Court, citing privacy protections in the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment, ruled that women have the right to an abortion. Since then, this Constitutional right has been under constant attack. \nAcross the country, state legislators have introduced dozens of bills to try to erode this right, with the goal of eventually overturning Roe v. Wade. These laws have imposed undue burdens on women in many states when trying to access abortion services. At the national level, the results of the 2016 election present the real possibility that this right could be overturned.  \nAs a physician, I am appalled at the distortions and misrepresentations used to justify these legislative attempts to infringe on this right. Lawmakers have used disproven statistics and discredited theories to justify their legislation under the guise of protecting women's health. \nAs a woman, I am appalled that legislators seek to impose their judgement on these most private decisions, and that they are attempting to insert the state into the doctor-patient relationship. Only women and their doctors know the reasons why an abortion is necessary, and only women should make this decision. \nRobust research from the Guttmacher Institute and the World Health Organization shows that attempts to make abortion illegal do not reduce abortion rates, and instead leave women to use unsafe methods to end their pregnancies. \nWe know there are ways to significantly reduce abortion rates: \n* Comprehensive Sex Education. Multiple studies have shown that when teens and young adults are given comprehensive sex education, unintended pregnancy rates and abortions are reduced.\n* Access to Reliable Birth Control. Long-acting contraceptives have been shown to reduce abortion rates by over 75%. \n* Eliminating Socioeconomic Barriers. Women who have access to paid maternity leave, comprehensive medical coverage, and child care are far less likely to choose abortion when an unintended pregnancy occurs. \nWe must protect a woman's right to seek an abortion, while using proven methods to reduce the need for abortions.",0,0,2

Our campaign has prepared legislation that we will submit immediately upon entering office to combat the sexual assault and sexual harassment epidemic in this country.\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\nImplement necessary affirmative consent reforms at our colleges and universities to combat campus sexual assault\nAbuse, assault, and rape have become and remain rampant on college campuses and military bases across the United States and abroad. More than 1 out of 5 women are victims of sexual assault on college campuses across the country. We need to ensure affirmative consent becomes the standard across publically-funded facilities.\n\nChange School Curriculum about consent\nWe need to transform the way we educate our children about consent, by implementing a curriculum that teaches middle school-age kids affirmative consent and helping them to understand what is allowed, what is inappropriate, and what to do if they find themselves in an inappropriate situation.\n\nReform the process for military sexual assault investigation and prosecution\nVictims of sexual assault should not feel pressured by an investigation conducted by their own chain of command. Investigations into the assault of a military personnel should be handled by a third-party.\nReform protocols on Campuses and in our Armed Forces\nRequire expert-led studies to determine the protocols and procedures that need to be put in place on campuses and in the military so that sexual violence survivors are provided with the resources and support that they need.

The advancement of women’s rights is a crucial step towards progressive change in America. True gender equality cannot be achieved when our citizens are being denied equitable pay, adequate health care coverage, access to contraceptives and abortions, or paid maternity leave– all issues that American women face every day. We need representatives in Congress who will actively work to improve the lives of women, a fight that is not confined to within our borders.\n\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n\nEnsure equal pay for equal work\nOn average, women in America are only paid about eighty percent of what men make, a rate that drops significantly for women who are black or latina. Compensating women and members of minority groups is ethically right and will help to further reduce wealth disparities between these communities and the privileged one percent.",0,0,2

I care about woman empowerment at every level, not just focusing on the bullet points. Empowering women economically, socially and politically improves the lives of all Americans, including the women. This win-win is the type of vision I will take to Congress.\nWomen make up nearly half of the country’s workforce, and are often the sole provider in the family, but are discriminated based on gender and penalized for having children. Women earn less than men, and moms earn even less than dads and women without children. Fighting for policies that expands access and opportunities for women will improve economic and social outcomes.\nAs a mother of six daughters and a working parent, I firmly believe women should be given every opportunity to be successful in life. This includes succeeding in the workplace, having the choice to start a family, earning a fair and equal wage, living free from violence having access to adequate healthcare. When women have the power to make decisions and have control over their lives, they can plan their economic futures.\nSimply put, I support:\nFamily choice, a woman’s right to choose and full rights to reproductive freedom, including access to affordable contraception\nPaid family leave and job protection\nProtecting women from workplace discrimination – regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation\nEqual pay for equal work\nEducational and employment opportunities, especially in the STEM fields\nFederal funding for programs that support women’s health\nI’m not about checking off boxes to make sure I get all my bullet points.

It is disturbing that women still receive 20% less pay than men, 80 cents on the dollar. Women of color receive even less. This kind of discrimination is illegal. John F. Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act into law in 1963. But it must be strengthened and given teeth. Too many women are heads of households and breadwinners. We must not defund the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and must allow the EEOC to collect pay information through the Employer Information Report. Otherwise, we operate in the dark. Leslie supports the Paycheck Fairness Act.\nGender wage discrimination has a severe impact on older women. According to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, 22 million older women receive Social Security benefits but receive, on average, $300 a month less than men. Leslie wants to help change that and supports the Eleanor's Hope initiative to promote women's retirement security. She also wants to equalize Social Security rules for disabled widows.\nWomen’s reproductive rights are under threat from the Trump administration and its allies in Congress. The irrational attacks on Planned Parenthood mean cruel and unusual punishment for millions of poor women. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that denying Planned Parenthood federal funding for one year will result in thousands of unwanted pregnancies. It will increase Medicaid spending by 21 million.\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, contraception was provided to poor women for next to nothing. Because of this, as of 2014, abortions declined to a record low.  For the first time since 1975, the abortion rate in the US fell to under a million. Publicly funded family planning visits saved state and federal governments over 13 billion dollars a year. Let’s respect a woman’s right to choose.\nLeslie wants to end Trump’s global gag rule. The rule denies US foreign aid to NGOs that provide sexual and reproductive health services, such as contraception and HIV testing, to women abroad. This is barbaric and should be reversed.\nThe proposed bills to demolish the Affordable Care Act have casually slashed maternity and newborn coverage, now regarded as essential care. This affects at least 9 million women. Whatever the final bill is, Leslie, a mother of three, will work to restore this coverage.",0,1,2

When we provide that--when we level the playing field for girls and women--we all benefit, truly.  Being a husband with a grown daughter has only intensified this commitment for me. The problem is that even today, that playing field remains very uneven. \nWhile we’ve made a good deal of progress in securing rights and opportunities for women in the US, three issues make it clear that we still have a long way to go:  First, the persistent gap in both pay and opportunities for women; second, violence against women, including both domestic violence and workplace sexual harassment and abuse; and third, the push to roll back and restrict women’s access to health care, from maternal health to contraception to reproductive services.\n* On average, women in the US now earn about 80% of what men earn for the same job and the same level of qualifications. For an annual salary of $50,000 per year, something a professional might earn in southwest Virginia, that translates to $10,000 less per year.  Keep in mind that wages for men have been pretty much stagnant, so it’s not that working men are doing great, just that women are struggling more.  I support the Paycheck Fairness Act, and other measures to achieve pay equity for women.\n \n* Educational, training and career advancement opportunities for girls and women are improving, but remain stuck in outdated ideas of what women are good at, capable of.  This is especially true of the tech industry and science and technology more broadly.  I’ll work to remove barriers to education and career advancement through promotion of STEM education and enforcement of equal opportunity laws.\n* The  National Network to End Domestic Violence reports no significant decrease in the numbers of women seeking help over the past two years. In rural areas, like the 9th District, domestic violence rates are more than 40% higher than in urban areas, even as victims are twice as likely not to have access to the assistance they need.  I support significant increases in funding for domestic violence prevention and treatment, particularly in rural communities, along with stronger protections for victims and penalties for abusers.\n \n* To reduce workplace sexual harassment, we must strengthen and enforce laws against harassment and abuse, increase penalties against corporations that allow harassment to continue without consequence, and dramatically restrict the use of ‘non-disclosure agreements’ that force employees to remain silent while abusers go unpunished.\n \n* For women, affordable health care is especially critical both because they have unique health care needs, and because they are more likely to work at a lower wage rate than men.  I support expanded access to health care, as we move towards a Medicare Choice for All system.\n \n* I support a woman’s right to choose, and I will work to support women, so that this difficult choice is made much less frequently.   We know how to reduce abortion rates: \no Affordable contraception, along with meaningful sex education for both girls and boys\no Paid maternity leave and good quality child care to new moms (and dads); nearly 70% of women choosing abortions are low income or working women whose economic circumstances drive their decisions\no Better educational and economic opportunities for girls and women, making unwanted pregnancy less likely",0,0,0

As a Congressman, Randy would support laws that would allow employees to refuse to disclose their current salary when applying for a new job, a question employers often ask to low-ball prospective candidates, and which has been shown to perpetuate the pay gap. Randy also supports a minority inclusion provision for the construction of FoxConn’s campus in Wisconsin’s First District, which would ensure 20% of the total construction cost went to minority and/or women business enterprises; 20% of the total worker hours were performed by minority and/or women workers; and 20% of the total worker hours were performed by minority and or/women apprentices. In contrast, Speaker Ryan voted against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act that made it easier for women to sue for persistent pay inequity.

In most families, women disproportionately take on the burden of being a caregiver. It often means they not only leave the workforce, but that they also dip into their own savings to fund the medical care need for their family member. As a Congressman, Randy would look to alleviate the financial and emotional burden placed on caregivers by supporting The Credit for Caring Act, which provides the caregiver up to $3,000 back on their taxes, and other measures.

Randy will also vote against bans on private and public insurance coverage for abortion such as the federal Hyde amendment, and he will support and advocate for inclusion of abortion coverage and comprehensive contraceptive coverage in public employee insurance plan. Additionally, Randy would vote against any legislation which attempts to restrict U.S. aid to international healthcare providers who provide a range of women’s healthcare services, including abortion.  Finally,  Randy will only support federal funding for evidence-based pregnancy prevention education.\nRandy believes it’s important that all those who identify as women have the healthcare they need. 

Randy fully believes that women should be able to serve in combat in our military. While Speaker Ryan refused to take a position on the issue, Randy believes, as a veteran, that it’s important to stand up for the women who want to serve our country – both in their pursuit of new roles in combat and when it comes to seeking justice for those female service members who face sexual harassment or assault. As a Congressman, Randy would vote for the Military Justice Improvement Act, which would give the authority to prosecute sexual assault and other serious crimes to independent military prosecutors, rather than military commanders, with whom it currently rests.

Randy knows much must still be done to end domestic violence, most urgently closing the “boyfriend” loophole and other loopholes in current federal law meant to protect victims of domestic violence from gun violence. While the majority of mass shooters have a history of domestic violence, and while victims of domestic violence are far more likely to be killed if their partner has a gun, federal law currently does not prevent a domestic abuser from accessing a weapon if they were not married to or did not have a child with their victim.  Additionally, federal law does not prohibit those convicted of misdemeanor stalking from accessing guns, despite the fact that stalking is a highly accurate predictor of future violent behavior. Finally, federal law also does not prohibit people with a temporary restraining order against them from obtaining a gun – even though the period after a victim has left their abuser is the most statistically dangerous time. As a Congressman, Randy would fight to close these unacceptable loopholes.\nRandy also recognizes that there is an epidemic of violence against transgender people – in particular, transgender women of color. He will work with community leaders and other stakeholders to develop proactive and comprehensive strategies to disrupt this violence and protect all trans people.  Randy recognizes that poverty is one of the root causes of this violence and he will work to ensure programs to address poverty and unemployment explicitly include transgender people (Including supporting affordable and streamlined access to appropriate identification documents).

Last Year, Betsy Devos rolled back protections for victims of sexual assault, discouraging victims from reporting and creating confusion among college campuses about how to handle these reports. As a Congressman, Randy would lobby to restore these protections, which finally provided victims a fair shot at justice and sent a strong message to all students to treat their partners with respect and to clearly obtain their consent at all times.",0,1,2
